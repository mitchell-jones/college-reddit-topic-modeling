btror,"Just finished my BS and am starting my MS - thought I would share my experience so far and some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

\---**Advice---**

These should be your priorities hands down:

Internships &gt; side projects &gt; grades.

If you have a garbage network and can't land an internship, prioritize side projects to boost your resume so you can get one. Go to career fairs so companies jot your name down and hopefully give you an interview. This got me one interview with BOA but I didn't get an offer in the end. I did do 2 SWE internships but had to find them without the school's help.

Also, for the love of christ please use ratemyprofessor before you sign up for classes. Avoid dipshit professors at all costs. I never had a professor I didn't like - but I know people who have.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**---Noteworthy stuff I remember---**

**Freshman year**

Learned basic programming. Became familiar with OOP concepts - the stuff you need to know if you want to be a software engineer. *Turtles*

Started my first side-project. It was a stupid length-unit-converter app that I put on the google play store with an ad banner. Googled how to do everything except for the logic (which is horrendous) and made an icon and everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sophomore year**

Data structures - they're important. My advice is to go above and beyond. Once you learn some of those and drill OOP into your head you can begin to do a lot of cool things.

I also started working on side projects. Studied the swing GUI library + threading and made visualizations of search algorithms (breadth-first and depth-first). It's not a unique project but I did it my own way and got a lot out of it.

\**some other stuff about operating systems I forgot about\**

&amp;#x200B;

**Junior year**

Took a class about web app development that was very good. Learned about frontend, backend, and database development and how to connect everything. Learned how to use some javascript frameworks (React and Angular mostly). Very valuable stuff. The final project helped me land an internship (which I'm doing now) that heavily utilizes javascript. I knew how the project worked inside and out and was able to talk about it a lot in interviews.

I also took the intro to ai class because it looked interesting. I ended up adding A\* to the swing project I did before.

\**some other stuff about RISC-V I 100% forgot about\**

&amp;#x200B;

**Summer before senior year**

Landed my first internship (not the javascript one) at an aerospace company. It was a research and development type of thing and I did everything in Python. Learned how to use that and some important libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

**Senior year**

Took the undergrad machine learning course. The first half sucked because there was no coding. It was purely research papers that were very miserable to do. In the second half, we started coding stuff and made some models with JupyterNotebook and sklearn. Cool stuff. I saw the value in it and decided to pursue it further (grad school here I come). 

Graduated in December (1 semester early) and landed a spring internship (the javascript one) that I'm doing now. Currently going very well. My manager offered to extend it through this summer and fall.

I still do some side projects. Currently making a Minecraft plugin. It's not really a \*growth\* thing to throw on a resume, I just like to tinker around a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final note**

At UNCC (and everywhere else) you will be taught the foundations and a litttttle bit further than that but if you want to get REALLY comfortable with a specific subfield you have to put a lot of work into that outside of school. It seems a lot of people expect to come out with a BS knowing how to code Facebook. If you just go to class - you won't even know how to publish a stupid length-unit-converter app to the play store.

CCI-Grab,"Alright, this post has been a long time coming. I started my undergrad in Computer Science here in 2017 planning on doing the Masters in 5 years program. Here I am, 5 years later, with a Masters. 

For clarity - my undergrad is CCI with a concentration in Software Engineering and my grad degree is in Information Technology with a concentration in Web Development. Additionally, 2017-2022 was a weird set of year. We had a horrible incident on campus that will forever change the school and it‚Äôs students. We also, like everyone else, dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these major events had an effect on my experience here and there is no way to know how my time at UNCC would have been different without them. 

With that out of the way, here‚Äôs my experience. It‚Äôs a long one but I‚Äôll have a TLDR at the bottom. Also feel free to ask question or add on your experience in the comments!

&amp;#x200B;

**Experience**

Freshman year was pretty great. The professors teaching the introduction to CS classes were fantastic. I‚Äôve heard other students complain about Dr. Java (that‚Äôs the name of a software, not a nickname of a professor but that should totally be a thing too) and the ‚Äùturtle assignments‚Äù but I thought they were a wonderful way to introduce concepts. I later tutored for CS classes and think the simplicity helped many students. To be fair, I has CS experience from high school so maybe I just thought they were easy and that made things better. UNCC also has many career opportunities, I took advantage of a lot of them freshman year but nothing came of any. I do think, however, a couple of the habits helped me in the long run. The end of the year celebrations/events made me enjoy finals, it was exciting and some of my favorite memories at UNCC were during this time.

Sophomore year I got more into my concentration. Data Structures and Calculus are genuinely some of the most useful courses I‚Äôve taken. I also lived on campus so participating in on campus events was pretty great. UNCC does not have the same lively campus NC State or UNCG has but it isn‚Äôt too bad with the light rail right there. The year was cut short, however, with the events of April 30th. I only bring this up because it was a significant part of my college experience. Out of respect, I won‚Äôt go into details but I will say I was not satisfied with how the school helped students thought it. I‚Äôm sure their heart was in the right place but I really wished they had done more to reach out.

Junior and Senior year were mostly from home. This is also the time where I would get to mostly take classes in my area of study. Sadly I don‚Äôt feel like many of them taught me much. The majority of the professors I had either knew what they were doing but not how to teach or knew neither. There were certainly some that broke the mold but they were rare. In lock down I spend a lot of my free time learning the basics of web development, got an internship through my own person networks, and continued school as an interrupt to my actual learning. I also ran into trouble with my advisor giving me bad information, delaying my graduation. This meant I would get my undergrad in 4 and a half years and need to really put my nose to the grindstone to get my MS on time.

Last year of college, the plus one off the ‚Äú4+1,‚Äù I spent one semester doing nothing because the mistake my advisor made and one semester with an overloaded schedule. This past semester has been the most stressful course load I‚Äôve had in college, I really with my advisor didn‚Äôt put me in that position. I had to get special permission to do 15 credit hours, when grad students were usually only aloud 12, and do a 0 credit hour capstone. The capstone was easy but it still added easily avoidable stress. The silver lining is that I now get to be done. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Reflection**

UNCC promised me great things as a CCI student, telling me they were the biggest Computer Science department in both the Carolinas. While the department‚Äôs courses start off strong, they fall off very quickly. Sadly, not quick enough for you to switch schools. I had four classes that I would consider useful to my career and $30,000 worth of classes that taught me how to take a test. With that said, I did get the piece of paper with ‚ÄúMasters‚Äù on it in 5 years. That‚Äôs roughly what the school can offer. If your only goal is to get a Masters ASAP, it can do that. In fact, you could probably do it in 4 years if you wanted. However, if you want to become a computer scientist and be prepared for the workforce, you‚Äôre better off spending a summer on Codecademy. I‚Äôm only speaking for the Software Engineering / Web Development side of things but I personally feel that my degree is not worth the paper it‚Äôs printed on (well I suppose the ink is probably worth more than the paper but you get the idea). UNCC did not aid my learning, they hindered it. By filling up my life with busy work, they made it harder for me to pursue my academic interests. I still aspire to get a PhD but I feel severely unequipped for research in my field of study. Even as someone looking to get a job, I find my technical skills have only gotten rusty by going to this school. I‚Äôm not knocking anyone who just wants to get in and get out with a degree ASAP though. That‚Äòs perfectly valid and UNCC is a great option for that. In my opinion, it is hard to fail the classes here if you put any amount of time into them. It‚Äôs a great school for getting your degree with as little friction as possible.

I don‚Äôt mean to bash the school or the professors here. I‚Äôve had some professors that I absolutely loved. Some professors are great at teaching, know their stuff, and genuinely care. Sadly, that is not the average professor. I also don‚Äôt want to speak outside of what I know. I‚Äôm sure other departments or even other concentrations in my department are better. Every single Writing and Math professor I‚Äôve had, I absolutely adored. My minor for my undergrad was Bioinformatics and that department and it‚Äôs professors are fantastic. The people there made me strongly considering going into that field alone. In the Software Engineering and Web Development track, however, you have to get lucky to land many great professors. UNCC is a factory to pump out Computer Science graduates for the banks in Charlotte. My biggest regret in college is not trying harder to get into a different school.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**TLDR**: UNCC has many wonderful aspects, some amazing professors, and a fun campus if you know what you‚Äôre looking for. However, they quality of the courses is (in my experience) questionable. If you want to learn software engineering, become a good developer, or further your career in academia, then UNCC is not for you. If you want to get degree and a decent well-paying job in computer science, UNCC can do that for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just some tips to new students to end this on a more positive note:

* Always work on personal projects. This is where you learn and what employers want to see. If you dedicated 2 hours a week, (mostly) every week, to some projects, you‚Äôll be ahead of the curb.
* Choose classes based on professor‚Äôs RateMyProfessor NOT based on timing. 8am‚Äôs suck, I know, but it‚Äôs worth the trade off. 
* Keep an active LinkedIn. Add everyone you can. Post thanking speakers. It‚Äôs a really easy way yo get involved with the greater community without actually doing much. 
* Go to clubs. They‚Äôre great, you‚Äôll make friends.
* Use the library to get work done, change spaces is super useful for productivity and our library is awesome. 
* Go to office hours. Always. Get in the habit of going just to review. Having that more person relationship with the professors and TA‚Äôs will make classes much less stressful.",UNCCharlotte,My experience at UNCC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/ussgcr/my_experience_at_uncc/,ussgcr,80,30,"05/18/2022, 21:50:32"

Hello Everyone! 

We wanted to come on here again to address the most recent car break ins. The latest information we posted about was related to the April 15th break ins. We understand there have been more since then and we are working with Police and Public Safety to understand and recommend short term plans while we wait for the long term security camera initiatives to be fully rolled out. We are continuing to gather information from students regarding the incidents. 

Tomorrow, Police Chief Baker will be attending Senate General Assembly to speak and give a more detailed answer to the steps being taken by their department. These meetings are open to the public so we encourage you to attend and use this opportunity to ask him questions. It will be at 5:30 pm in the Lucas Room at Cone. 

Following this, we hope to have more answers and we will let you all know the updated security response. 

In the meantime, if your car has been broken into and you have not yet filed a police report we strongly encourage you to do so and report all damaged and missing items. 

Students safety is of the utmost importance and we are doing everything in our power to provide you all with a diligent response to these incidents.

Looking to lease for June July, most likely willing to give up the lease entirely if interested. Rent is 674 monthly, utilities included.

The complex is Walden Station, its across from right across from campus, next to the shopping center with Starbucks, Chipotle, etc, and the light rail, if you know the area.

3bed/3bath 1256sq ft; you'd get one of the rooms (bedroom A on the websites floor plans), fully furnished, with your own bathroom. Washer dryer included.

There are two other roommates; both super chill and clean, both girls. The area is safe, free parking, not sketchy like some other complexes lol. also I've literally never seen a bug in my room ever so that cool, because some other areas have that issue

chris102099,"I've already tried talking to the financial aid office about this, and all they tell me is extremely disheartening information, and I don't know how far it stretches.

Basically, I have had an extremely rough semester, I was previously a 4.0 GPA student consistently, and have even gotten accepted into graduate school. This semester has been very difficult for me, and I made the tough decision to withdraw from two of my four classes to just ease some of this stress and give myself a break. I have come to the conclusion that I want to leave UNC Charlotte and move to a technical school and not transfer any of my credits, I hate this degree and it's only worsening my mental health.

I was told by UNCC that as long as I pass these two classes my financial aid will be fine, but if I fail them, I will have to ""pay back my loans"" which is f\*\*ing SCARING ME! I started out the semester okay, and I was making Bs-Cs, which was sufficient for me given this semester has been horrible and I just want to escape. I have just screwed up my final project for a class, as I accidentally used sources that were heavily biased towards a mythological opinion, and I did not realize until the end of class when my teacher very passive agressively corrected me, and I'm just assuming now I have an F on my final project! And I just can't take this. I just want to get out of here. I want to transfer schools, and start over. But the school has placed this threat of paying my loans back effective immediately if I flunk, and I'm trying so hard not to crack and I just am falling apart. The impression they have given me is if I fail here this semester after withdrawing my classes, I'm screwed, I can't leave, I can't go to school somewhere else because financial aid will no longer want ot help me, and I'm just freaking out so badly. I don't know what to do. I just want to escape, I want an education and a job, and I don't know what to do.

Does anyone know how this works? am I screwed? I really don't know what to do, I'm trying so hard but nothing seems to be working in my favor.

sry1024,"Last night there was a man wearing a staff shirt who was not staff or a student who was harassing students, myself included. Around 10:30pm he was on the fourth floor of Lynch Hall where fortunately two male students had stopped him before anything had happened. When walking past the situation he had verbally harassed both me and my roommate saying ‚ÄúI like them with glasses‚Äù and ‚Äúthick thighs saves lives‚Äù while staring us down. At this point we had basically ran back to our room as the two guys seemed to have him confined in one area and an RA was involved. 
So this morning I head to the campus yikyak and find other people posting about this man. Not only has he made his way into different residence halls, he has also gotten into UREC and followed a girl home! Campus police had gotten involved both times, removed him from the situation. But it seems since he is repeatedly making issues in the same night that campus police are simply taking him out of the situation and dumping him somewhere nearby. 
Why isn‚Äôt there something serious being done when he is a repeated threat? Not only that but there has been no alert by campus regarding this.

1) which hall do you prefer for the 4-person/4-bedroom apartment? It seems like the main difference is the amount of bathrooms from what I can see online but I was curious of the opinion from students. 

2) Do the doors to the bedroom  for the 4-person/4-bedroom apartments in either hall have locks I can use when I leave my bedroom? I don't see anything about this online or mentioned in the housing tour videos. This is my main concern tbh so I can have the peace of mind when I leave the apartment.",UNCCharlotte,Witherspoon Hall vs. Wallis Hall Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/u2fdkq/witherspoon_hall_vs_wallis_hall_question/,u2fdkq,8,11,"04/12/2022, 22:02:35"

EveninqSkies,"Hey Niners!

Some of you may recognize me as a semi-frequent user of this subreddit. Some of you may not. And that's alright - I'll introduce myself. My name is Trinity and it's a pleasure to meet you all! I'd like to address something I've noticed lately to hopefully shine a spotlight on the difficulties that some students here may face. Since the general topic of the ""food crisis"" has been coming up, I've decided to bring attention to another aspect many of us don't know about.

As some of you may have noticed, both Sovi and Crown have been adding things to their menu as of late (occasional alfredo, extra fruits or breads during breakfast hours, sides during lunch and dinner, etc). This in of itself is not a problem. The main problem is that the online menus are not updated to reflect these additions.

""Alright Trinity,"" you might be saying. ""This is a minor problem. This isn't why you're making a post."" And you would be correct in saying that. There's another reason I'm making this post, and it does relate to the menu issue: Sovi and Crown have both been replacing items on their menu. This isn't the problem itself - we know about shortages and supply issues - the problem is that they're not updating their menus online or the menus on the screens in the dining halls to reflect these changes. 

I have a friend who has food allergies. I myself also have a few (luckily minor) food allergies. I have gone to eat with my friend before and, to be quite frank, it's disheartening to see him sit down with only french fries or a drink because he doesn‚Äôt like the only gluten free option on the menu or isn‚Äôt sure if he can eat it because the menu changed, while I have a plate of food that I know is safe for my consumption that I won't possibly get sick from eating.

Sometimes, the Gluten Free sections don't have their items marked as gluten free and my friend has to ask if the food is edible - while the Gluten Free section should be unequivocally gluten free, many students can't take the risk that it's not - because making the mistake of not asking could result in a hospital stay. Which is unacceptable and very much Not Cool‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

Other days, the main kitchen areas will have all of their items marked as gluten free, but they've added noodles or another non-gluten free option as an addition that is not marked on the menu. All it takes is someone not paying attention fully, skimming over the menu just to check the symbols, seeing that everything is gluten free, and taking a bite of those noodles that weren‚Äôt listed for the potential of illness.

Now, I know some of you might be thinking about what I mentioned about my gluten-free friend not eating much off the menu, and decided to prematurely address some of the comments that I may receive.

""Your friend can just make a salad."" Some people may argue.

Maybe my friend could just make a salad - but who wants to make a salad with ingredients that have been sitting out for hours? We don't know that the ingredients are still fresh, nor that they haven't been contaminated by someone touching it, coughing in that direction, spit getting onto it due to people talking, etc. There are plenty of times that he‚Äôs had a salad, but sometimes that just isn‚Äôt feasible due to the quality of the ingredients. 

I've gotten fruit later in the day myself that is all unfit to eat and I've had to throw it out because it was all squishy, smelly, and tasted gross. There have also been times where I've had to skip the fruit section due to seeing clear cross contamination between the different fruits. As someone who is allergic to pineapple, it's annoying to have to pick around the pineapple that accidentally fell into the cantaloupe to find pieces of cantaloupe that aren't contaminated. But, as weird as this may sound, I'm lucky in this regard. Many people will have to avoid eating their favorite fruits because they can't take the risk like I can. I can take a benadryl and go to sleep. Others could potentially go to the hospital.

""Your friend can just make a sandwich."" Others may say.

The gluten free bread is not replaced as often as the other breads. My friend has mentioned they‚Äôve possibly had the same bread out for a week or two before. There have been times where he‚Äôs gone to make a sandwich and the bread has been mushed, damaged, or broken in the bag. And again, the same ingredients, such as the meats and cheeses, sit out for hours - I would feel a little concerned eating that too!

""There's always at least one gluten free option on the menu."" They may claim.

And people without dietary restrictions have at least four different food options to choose from each night, yet some of us complain about a lack of options. How would you feel being stuck to eating one thing on the menu, even if you hated it? Many of the gluten free options at the Gluten Free station have seafood or other types of meat in them, which is unfortunate for people who don't want to risk eating raw meats (as many of us are dealing with, hence the food crisis) or who don't like/are allergic to seafood, which is a pretty common allergy.

We pay thousands of dollars to access the food here. We have seen what can be done when resources have been properly allocated to the chefs - see the menu for the meeting with executives that Sovi had about a month or two ago. The food quality in comparison to what we as students usually get was a drastic improvement, and to be quite frank, I find it rather disappointing that UNCC would so clearly show us students that while they can do better, they just don't want to.

Don't get me wrong, however, as not *everything* is bad. The staff - especially at Sovi from what I‚Äôve personally seen -  has been working hard to make things more accessible for students. I can see that they genuinely care for the students and our well-being. Students with allergies, if you're not aware - the dessert section at Sovi now has nutrition tags (marking things as vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free) thanks to the work of the staff members at Sovi. It‚Äôs a blessing to see my friend not have to worry as much and be able to eat something without stressing about it! If there's anything you're uncertain about, ask the staff - I‚Äôm pretty sure they have some type of ingredient list if there‚Äôs a certain dessert you‚Äôre concerned about. We all thank the staff for their kindness and service. 

Despite these improvements, however, there are still many problems to address that I have mentioned in my post. Here's what I would like the outcome from this post to be:

1. The menus should be correct and up-to-date come every meal. I should be able to pull up Dine-on-Campus and be able to know *exactly* what each dining hall is having for food at the time I pull it up. I can understand things a few days away being incorrect, but the menu for the current day should be completely accurate. I should be able to see which options are gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, or balanced. They should all be marked correctly. Obviously mistakes will occasionally happen - we're human. However, mistakes happening on a nearly daily basis is unacceptable and unsafe.

2. Ingredients at the fruits and deli section should be fresh - this includes fruits, meats, and breads. Perhaps we could add lids or covers on top of each ingredient section and inspect/check the breads daily to make sure that it‚Äôs quality. This would solve both the freshness and the cross-contamination.
 
3. More diversity for gluten-free options. Rooted often has a few different dishes. Why can the gluten free section not have a variety of options too? My friend mentioned to me offhandedly once that the gluten free food was more diverse and higher-quality at the beginning of the year. I‚Äôve been noticing lately that from what he gets when we eat together the food they offer doesn‚Äôt seem to have a lot of variety.

4. Other aspects of the current food crisis - such as raw meats, undercooked foods, or contaminated foods - should be solved as well to drastically improve the experience of all students as well as our students with dietary restrictions.

To wrap things up: some of you may be confused as to why I'm the one posting this rather than my friend. The answer is that my friend would rather remain anonymous for personal reasons. So I offered to write this post for him and he accepted. If you have any questions for him, he'll likely be reading through the comments and can relay his answers to me. I have also sent him this post in advance to have him check it over and make sure I addressed all of his concerns. It's important that people with food allergies are heard here.

If anyone with allergies or dietary restrictions would like to add their experience in the comments, I would greatly appreciate seeing different perspectives and your thoughts on my suggested ""solutions"". Perhaps some of us have had better experiences than others - however, a gentle reminder that just because you haven't experienced a certain issue, it doesn't mean that it's not a problem that other students are facing. 

Thank you all for reading this far! I greatly appreciate your time and support. Feel free to ask questions or mention any concerns you may have.

I'm toured some schools and went for UNCC's open house. I kinda like it over there, but I'm not too sure about it yet..

So I wanted to get some opinions from students who can definitely mention some cons of UNCC instead of campus guides who are paid to only say nice things (no hate though!! i really loved our guides). 
Or maybe tell me what parts you love about it! Judging from the raw chicken posts, probably not the food lol

In my opinion recovery, while different for everyone, similar elements exist among varying conditions. 

I have done my research so I am aware that the Charlotte area has plenty of support groups, which is one of the main reasons I chose school! However, I was curious to hear first hand from students what they thought of the community in general at Charlotte. Do you all feel it‚Äôs positive and provides plenty of resources to succeed despite personal conditions? Is the overall atmosphere of the school one of challenging but rewarding academic rigor? Why or why not?

I will end by saying that I have a strong support network that I thoroughly discuss these same topics with on a just about daily basis. I also realize that it is my responsibility to find what I‚Äôm looking for when it comes to happiness and success. I was just curious to hear some input straight from the source. :)

darkshadowtrail,"In Fall I have a couple of options. I can either take MATH 1242 or STAT 1220, both of which would be required for me because I'm trying to double major in Computer Science and Economics. I didn't choose CS until early this semester, so I'm behind a bit on courses and have to take ITSC 1212 in the Fall as well to catch up a bit.

My original plan was to take MATH and ITSC in the Fall since I'm in 1241 right now and will have everything in memory, then take STAT in the Spring. I wanted ITSC with Long because that's who everyone seems to be recommending, but the only problem is his only sections are at the same time as John Taylor's MATH sections. It seems that all the other instructors have low RMP scores for ITSC and MATH.

What should I do here? Should I take ITSC with someone else or go ahead and knock out STAT and take MATH 1242 in the Spring? Below are my options for instructors if anyone would like to chime in and give their experience:

* Making the Charlotte community a better place to live and work.
* Learning about the environmental impact of food waste and how to help.
* Add your participation on the committee to a grad school/job application.
* Letter of reference provided by the Executive Director.

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I am your outgoing Student Body President, and today officially marks my last day in office. I wanted to come on here and share one last message to the sub that has provided so much support and encouragement over the past nearly two years.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start off by thanking y'all. Y'all gave me the opportunity of a lifetime, to represent y'all and to serve as y'alls advocate. Every day, living up to that responsibility was both a privilege and an honor, and I hope that my work reflected the gratitude I have towards y'all for putting me in this position. It is my hope that if nothing else, you felt truly represented and heard by Student Government during my time in office. I cannot thank you enough for the opportunity to serve you.

&amp;#x200B;

I started on this sub during a low point for Student Government. During Summer 2020, when the school announced reopening plans that the Student Body was in near universal opposition towards, [people had to openly ask where our Student Government was](https://imgur.com/a/hVHehPE). That post bothered me on a deep level. I got involved in Student Government to make a difference and to work for students. So I hoped on this sub, made my first post explaining what was going on, what we were doing, and more. I expected to get crucified, I was shocked when I didn't, and the rest was history. I'm proud that during my term nobody had to ask where Student Government was. Y'all knew that all you had to do was tag me or reach out, and your concerns would be heard and acted upon.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be remiss if I were to act as though my success is mine alone. I have been assisted by an incredible cabinet throughout my time as Student Body President. These people worked incredibly hard behind the scenes on your behalf, and I wish they got the attention they deserve. I cannot say enough good things about the work that they did or the passion they have for y'all. I need to acknowledge the various faculty, staff, and administrators who made it a point to regularly meet with me and hear your concerns, and then use their power to enact change. Y'all we have incredible people here who genuinely care about our students above all else. I wish everyone could see and hear what I did behind closed doors when important decisions were being made and considered. Y'alls concerns and opinions were at the forefront of everyones minds, and that made my job a heck of a lot easier. Last, but certainly not least, I want to give a special acknowledgment to Chancellor Gaber. Y'all, we have the best Chancellor in the entire UNC System. I'm not just saying that. I've had the chance to talk to every other Student Body President about our Chancellor's and ours blows all the rest out of the water. I have never met a more transparent and caring leader, and I cannot even begin to tell you how accessible she has made herself. I always knew that if I ever needed to, Chancellor Gaber was never more than a phone call away, and that she would move mountains for our students. I prepare for graduation knowing our Student Body is in the best hands possible, and I am so excited to watch from afar as an alum at the leadership Chancellor Gaber will provide our school moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

As I officially hand over my successor, Tatiyana Larson (u/tatiyanatifesbp), I do want to say a few words about her. I have had the pleasure of knowing Tatiyana since my freshman year. She served on my class council when I was Freshman Class President, replaced me as the Sophomore Class President, and has served on my cabinet as my Secretary for Student Affairs. I have seen firsthand on a daily basis for the past three years the pure love she has for student advocacy. I consider her not just a professional colleague, but also a friend, and I know that y'all are going to love her and the work she does. You can bring your concerns to her, and I promise you she'll take them just as seriously as I did.

&amp;#x200B;

As I end my term, I will be stepping away from this sub and retiring this account (though I may need some graduation tickets, so don't be surprised if you see one last post lol). Tatiyana deserves the chance to step into the role without me remaining on this sub as a distraction from the great work she's going to do, and quite frankly y'all I think I've earned a break lol. Over the next few weeks, I'll be focusing on myself, my two honors theses (still haven't learned the correct plural form of thesis), preparing for graduation, and getting ready for Wake Forest Law in the fall. As always, thank you again for the privilege of serving you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Go Niners,

Hi Everyone,

‚ÄúIt is in your hands, to make a better world for all who live in it.‚Äù ‚Äì Nelson Mandela

It‚Äôs mid-week, we‚Äôre halfway to the weekend! Come on by History Club to celebrate with a Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon movie from 2009: Invictus. 

Have you ever wanted to know more about South African history? Or President Nelson Mandela and his efforts post-Apartheid? Or are you a rugby fan? 

Maybe you‚Äôre just a major Morgan Freeman fan like me!

Any of the above and this movie, named for William Ernest Henley‚Äôs poem about self-governance and self-reliance ‚ÄúInvictus,‚Äù should be a great watch. 

Afterward we‚Äôll look back at history to discover what this movie got right and wrong, in both the spirit of things and the details.

My experience/ rant:
I have had 3 different CS advisors and only one has been decent. The other 2 have either given blatantly incorrect advice and advised me to take classes that made no sense/ I literally couldn't take or ignored my questions and just told me to look at DegreeWorks. I know that they probably didn't intend to do advising and the college just threw students at them to deal with.

All tutors in the Writing Resources Center learn about writing concepts, tutoring practices, and collaboration through the course WRDS 4402 (non-English majors) and ENGL 4400/5400. As part of the coursework, students tutor for 3 hours per week in the center. After successful completion of the course, you may get hired on as a paid tutor in subsequent semester. We have many tutors who take the course in their sophomore or junior years and stay on as a paid tutor until graduation!

However, I have decided to minor in Data Science as it is interesting to me and I really want a computer science background. The problem is I would need to add an extra semester in the Fall of 2023. I am okay with doing this, but I have little knowledge of the difficulty of certain data science classes so I wanted to get input about how my next year is planned out. Most specifically the final semester, because all the data science classes say I need Intro to computer II so I have to push them back till after I finish it. Is it doable to have those three data science classes in one semester?

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. While I've been busy working on the transition between myself and incoming Student Body President Tatiyana Larson (more on that later), I wanted to hop on here and provide some updates regarding some initiatives I've been working on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Student Union Pool Tables-** A few of y'all have reached out, either [on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/ti61ta/timeout_it_costs_money_to_play_pool_at_student/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), via email, or by walking up to me in person and expressed frustration that the Student Union charges students for games of pool. I've heard your concerns and have spoken with Morgan Meehan, the Director of the Student Union, and they're now exploring the possibility of including this in their annual budget, meaning students would not have to pay per game. I have to stress this is in the early processes and not finalized by any means, but I thought y'all deserved to know that it's being looked into and worked on. Morgan deserves a lot of credit for the openness she displayed towards this feedback and the work her team is doing to see if this is possible. I don't anticipate this being resolved during my last 9 days in office, but the wheels of change are (hopefully) in motion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Graduation-** I spoke with Chancellor Gaber today about the confusion surrounding graduation plans. What I know is that graduation will be in Jerry Richardson Stadium (rain or shine) and that students will be allowed to bring as many guests as they desire (we're not concerned with space limitations the way we would be in Halton Arena). In February, an email was sent out indicating that more information would be sent out in mid-March. Considering the date, I've asked for an update regarding that email and as soon as I have it, I'll come on here and edit this post.

&amp;#x200B;

**SGA Election Results-** This past Thursday, election results were announced for Student Government. With that came the news that y'all have selected Tatiyana Larson and Tife Olusesi to be your next Student Body President and Vice President. I cannot say enough phenomenal things about both of these people. I have known both since my freshman year and have had the privilege of working closely with them since then. I have seen firsthand the deep care and compassion they have for the Student Body, and consider both of them to be great friends and even better student advocates. I feel very satisfied knowing that I will be turning over my work to such fantastic people. I have a farewell post planned, so I'll save the remainder of my remarks for then, but just know y'all are being left in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

I've taken time away from this sub to allow for other voices (voices that will be here after I graduate) to have a chance to establish themselves, and it brings a lot of personal joy to see Student Government recognize the value of communicating to the Student Body through this sub. It has been a pleasure to write what I assume is my last ""update"" post, and I look forward to sharing my closing thoughts with you all on the last day of my administration. Until then, thank you as always for the continued pleasure and privilege of serving as your Student Body President.

SeaworthinessOk5308,"Hey everyone, so I made an app that is a map with a navigation system that is essentially compass that points you in the direction of people or places (you can also see how far away you are).

The map auto-populates with events happening TODAY so you'll be able to plan out your next excursion. If you find cool places, you can also add them to the map for other users to find or mark locations just for yourself. Personally, as I only know of stuff around where I live, I've added stuff there but if you know of any cool spots you want to share, throw them on the map!

When you save/bookmark things on the map, the app learns what you like and makes recommendations!

If you're traveling with a buddy, you can keep track of them by linking your devices by what I call 'joining a group'. That way, you can just be pointed in their direction and see how far they are from you or you can just see them on the map.

Please give it a try and let me know what you think and how it can be improved :D

Arthix,"Alumni here who commonly uses the greenway going through UNCC, it'd be great if the bathrooms in the Alumni Pavilion outside the Student Union could stay unlocked.

They're the closest bathrooms to the greenway and make things a lot more pedestrian friendly. I've also noticed the water fountains there are turned off half the time.

cosmicami,I was a middle college student and I enrolled at UNCC this Jan. I jumped up to a junior. I am double majoring in French and International Studies. My previous 2 year college didn't offer many classes related to my program so I have to take all of these classes in 3 semesters. I don't want to be full of classes bc it sucks (i know from experience). I don't know if maybe I should just minor in International Studies. Any advice?

Mayonaisepainting101,"I‚Äôm fully vaxxed as per last October. It took that because my parents didn‚Äôt want me to get the Covid vaccine. I was really happy to now be fully vaccinated except during my second dose I almost passed out. But it was now over and I felt comfortable and had absolutely no symptoms.

But on Tuesday I woke up to find that my niner credentials were about to be suspended. I check my emails so I must‚Äôve glossed over something. 6 months after Moderna is what‚Äôs recommended to get the booster but UNCC changed it to 5 months? So I was slightly blindsided but I got the test done quickly. 

But honestly I don‚Äôt really want or see the need to get boosted? It‚Äôs weird that my fully vaccinated status is no longer valid. I honestly thought boosters were optional, but I‚Äôm not a stem major so who am I to judge.

HeroesAndComics,"The meeting for Heroes &amp; Comics this week is about *The Batman*. Figured some people here might be interested in it! Our meeting is Friday at 3:30pm-5:00pm in FRIDY 132.

For context, our club meetings are usually just a small group discussing something comic book related. It's usually a small group so it's easy to jump in on the conversation. You don't need to know anything about comics to participate, usually people join not knowing much about comics and get into it more through the meetings. We also have a decent amount of movie/TV discussion - anything comic related! 

*The Batman* is a pretty big deal in our universe and we've already had a variety of takes on it in our discord (feel free to join [our discord](https://discord.com/invite/XCqVsNR)! If you want to talk about the movie, you'll want to ask to join the batman-spoiler-chat though. Just something we do so people can't accidentally see spoilers.)

 If you've seen it we'd love to hear your thoughts on it Friday!

Our in-person meetings are on **Fridays in FRIDY 132 from 3:30pm-5:00pm**. We also have discord only meetings on Monday's at 4pm for anyone who can't make it. We're also kicking around moving times around though so if you want to join but can't due to timing feel free to let us know on discord!

AnchorsThrone,"Hey, so as of last weekend I was accepted into UNCC for later this year and I have a few questions since I'm pretty interested in this college compared to others I've already been accepted too.

1. What are the recommended housing options for a freshman?
I prefer having privacy and I saw that a few of the halls have options for single occupancy / 1 person bedrooms. What are the best halls and what are the chances I will get into one of them? (I know that I'll have lower priority for some places since I'm a freshman.)

2. Career path change?
I applied in October last year for Engineering - Undecided and since then I have found myself wanting to pursue a forensic science career. Is it easy to get this changed once I attend?

3. Pet policy?
Compared to the other schools I have applied to I noticed that this place had some sort of pet policy so I was curious about that. I have a very loving kitty at home that I would love to bring along with me if possible.

4. Internet?
I have a laptop that is kind of a pain to use when connecting to WiFi so I'm wondering how good the connection is with that. Also I've heard that there is a wired option (via ethernet ports that are in rooms) and I'm wondering how good the connection is on those. I'm also thinking about bringing my playstation along just in case I get bored so the same situation applies to that device.

5. Any extra info I should know?
I do plan to visit this college in the next month or so to check out the campus but I'm very new to a lot of this, especially North Carolina as a whole (I live in SC currently). Anything extra that I should know as a freshman?",UNCCharlotte,I was recently accepted to this college for fall 2022 and I have a few questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/tfh16b/i_was_recently_accepted_to_this_college_for_fall/,tfh16b,20,11,"03/16/2022, 08:55:49"

a-aron087,"Disclaimer: *This is in no way meant to bash or call out Ms. Thurman.* Overall she is a wonderful person and really does a lot for students enrolled in the College of Engineering. She is simply the messenger. This is meant to shed some additional light on the co-op program for those that may be considering it. Additionally, some things may have changed since I completed my co op during Spring-Summer of 2020. I doubt it but be sure to do your due diligence.

As someone who has participated in the co-op program I wanted to provide some clarification. For starters, the co-op program is in NO WAY formal nor academic as the school may want you to believe. In my experience there was no interaction between the university and my employer, there was no educational aspect to the program (outside of the experience I gained working for my employer), nor was there any interaction between the school and myself during my co-op. I had a presentation midway through and then participated on a discussion panel once my co-op ended. 

Secondly, be prepared for your loans to enter repayment. You get 6 months of deferment. 6 MONTHS PERIOD. For reference a co-op is 8 months long. If you use all of your 6 months during the co-op then you have no deferment left. At all. When you enroll in the co-op course you are enrolled in ZERO credit hours. To anyone other than the office of the registrar you are not an ""at least half time enrolled"" student.

As a student not at least half time enrolled this means:

* You aren't eligible for housing on campus (this is extremely important if you are entering into a co op in the spring as you will likely have already signed the housing contract and will be liable for damages if you leave/become ineligible)
* Your financial aid will be significantly reduced/ be completely revoked (Depends on the situation. For me I was at risk of losing it all for the Spring)
* Your loans will enter either deferment or repayment. Your choice.
* You WILL graduate late. Everyone's situation is different so for some this isn't a huge deal but it does mean that you will likely incur additional cost.

Finally, I received no help from the university in making this process easier. As soon as I agreed to everything it felt as though I was ignored. It was up to me to do the research on what I needed to do. It was up to me to make sure I didn't become homeless or have to resort to a 1.5 hour commute to my employer. I had to be my own advocate against FAFSA, Housing and Residence Life, and all three of my loan servicers. I'll spare you the suspense, they all told me ""tough shit"". Ultimately, I enrolled in 2 online courses to maintain a half time status and had it not been for COVID I doubt that would have been possible. 

I write this post not to scare people away from the co-op program, but to inform people of the consequences and trade-offs you have to make. If you can afford it then it can be very beneficial. If a Professional Engineering license is important to you, then upon completion of the program (3 rotations; a rotation is 1 semester or 4 months) you will be awarded a year of experience towards it. If any of y'all need help with navigating the co-op program feel free to message me and I can help out as best I can. 

The Engineering Co-Op program has a long way to go before I can wholeheartedly recommend it and it needs to start with advocating for its participants.

Student Government Elections have officially started. They will be open until tomorrow (Wednesday), but I encourage you to go ahead and vote now so you don‚Äôt forget. It shouldn‚Äôt take long as there are only about three positions and two bills to vote on. When voting, due to the new Rank Choice Voting system SGA implemented, you will rank the candidates you see from your favorite to least favorite. The positions you will be voting for are Student Body President and Vice President,your respective Class President, and your respective college- based Senator. When voting on either of the two bills, you will just be given a yes or no choice. Here is the link to vote, I also encourage you to review each candidate and bill option when voting:

I also wanted to strongly urge everyone reading this to consider Jeremiah Williams and Abigail Warren strongly for Student Body President and Vice President. Not only have they proven themselves and their effectiveness in the past, but they also have a strong ‚ÄúTop 3‚Äù that would carry their presidency to great success. To read up on their [background](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/swggvo/williamswarren_for_student_body_president_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [‚ÄúTop 3,‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/szjk88/williamswarren_student_body_president_and_vice/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) click the links which I embedded on those words. You can also read check out my Reddit account where I have more posts regarding things they promise to get done and why they are excellent candidates.¬†

I know a lot of you are wondering about communication through Reddit with SGA because Dick Beekman is leaving. Because of this, Jeremiah offered me a position with his staff and he promised that I could focus on Reddit in order to build that same relationship and level of communication with y‚Äôall that Dick had. Jeremiah will also be active in Reddit so you will get a 2-for-1 deal and it will ensure that every question or issue present on this Reddit page about the University is not only listened to, but dealt with properly. I have been doing the SGA Updates for the past few months on here and it is definitely something I love doing. I hope to be able to build top-tier communication with y‚Äôall alongside Jeremiah and Abigail as I know they would do great things as Student Body President and Vice President.¬†

Smittywarbenjagermen,"As a senior in high school, deciding on a major was more difficult for me than some of my friends. I felt split on getting a degree in the Business field or a degree in IT/CS, but I was really excited to learn about MIS, which sort of fuses the two together to my understanding.

I now have to decide between pursuing this degree at Charlotte, App State, ECU, or OU. So far I‚Äôve been accepted everywhere I applied except NC State, which I‚Äôm supposed to get a decision from by March 30th. Though they dont technically offer an MIS degree, I would consider going to NCSU because it‚Äôs close to home and there‚Äôs something to be said about their reputation. I have to make my final decision by May 1st.

So, I‚Äôd love to hear about everyone‚Äôs experiences at Charlotte, specifically when it comes to anyone majoring in Management Information Systems. Even better if you have experience with or know somebody who attends another university I listed. I‚Äôm really having a tough time narrowing it down past this point, so any perspective you can add is much appreciated.

I‚Äôve toured the campus recently and I loved how new and spaced out everything is, and having Charlotte a 20 minute train ride away seems like a great opportunity. What are some unique things you like about the campus/location?

PS: One thing that really concerns me with Charlotte is their reported graduation rates seem really low compared to other universities I‚Äôm considering. Is this relevant? In your experience is it difficult to get the classes you want or is there anything that seems to make your path to graduation unusually difficult?",UNCCharlotte,Management Information Systems (MIS) Degree at UNC Charlotte?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/tecdr6/management_information_systems_mis_degree_at_unc/,tecdr6,8,4,"03/14/2022, 20:43:48"

12PercentWifi,"Not sure why the hell I am looking for roommates on Reddit of all places, but there seems to be a diverse crowd of students in this sub so I figured it would be a good starting place. 

I am Ryan, a 22 year old male, currently looking for 2-3 other potential roommates that would be interested in renting out a house within a 20 minute drive to campus. I just started looking at rentals around the area, but have yet to locate anything specific and am looking to find a few others who might be interested so that we could all settle on a place that works best for us.

A bit about me: 
I am returning to UNCC from the Raleigh area after a 2 year break following my departure from the school halfway through my freshman year. I just finished my Associates Degree in Arts and will be returning as an English major with a minor in Secondary Education. 
Some of my interests include, videogames, LEGO, reading, movies, occasionally smoking weed (Never in the house), and listening to boomer tunes from the 50s and 60s. I am currently working as a substitute teacher and as a line cook, building up money so that I can ensure that I won‚Äôt have to work for a while after moving back to Charlotte. I am a charismatic individual that is very outgoing and easy to get a long with.

Feel free to comment if you are also looking for roommates interested in living in a rental house off campus. Once again, this is just a preliminary post to try and find people that are interested; I do not have a house yet and am not in a rush to lock down anything just quite yet.

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,

I hope this finds you well. For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is part of the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y‚Äôall on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.

**Mask Mandate Update-** As many of y‚Äôall may have heard from a [NinerNotice](https://emergency.charlotte.edu/communications/ninernotice/latest-ninernotices) on February 28th, as of last Monday, March 7th, masks are now optional on campus in indoor settings. This comes in response to a [memorandum to UNC System Chancellors](https://www.northcarolina.edu/wp-content/uploads/reports-and-documents/president-docs/president-hans-covid-protocols-memo-25-february-2022.pdf), stating that chancellors ‚Äúexercise this authority by instituting mask-optional protocols in all campus indoor settings, including classrooms, no later than March 7.‚Äù It is still recommended, per CDC guidelines, that unvaccinated people or those who are at high risk for complications wear face coverings in indoor settings. Alongside this, those who are not up to date with vaccines, unvaccinated or no booster shot if applicable, are required to complete a COVID test within the week of March 14th to 18th because of an expected surge from Spring Break. The University‚Äôs testing policy will continue as it has been. Again, to reiterate, masks are now optional on all places on campus. Professors cannot require you to wear masks or change your grade in order to make you put a face covering on. If a situation arises where a professor does require you to wear a mask or they change your grade because of your choice, please fill out the Academic Complaint Form. Academic Affairs will then deal with the situation properly. This does not mean that professors can not say they would prefer for you to wear a mask. They just can not require it or damage your grade if you chose not to.

**Dining Services-** Last Friday, I met with Dining Services‚Äô Director of Board Dining, Cindy Torrence, and Dining Services‚Äô Director of Operations, Jorge Elizagaray. This was in response to multiple complaints on the UNC Charlotte Reddit in regards to the chicken tender quality at Crown2Go. This was the result of a switch in vendors for the chicken tenders. Because of the disappointing quality from the vendor, they switched to their third vendor last Tuesday and have not seen any major quality issues since. Because this quality issue has been resolved, I spoke with Cindy Torrence and Jorge Elizagaray to gain more clarification about Crown2Go. As someone who lives on campus, I know the struggle of timing with Crown2Go. This issue comes from students overloading the system due to it being the only place open on campus late at night. Dining Services wants to hear feedback from students about what y‚Äôall think late night dining should be like. Please take into consideration that staffing is still not up to its former numbers but it is getting better as COVID restrictions diminish. I intend to continue conversations with both Jorge Elizagaray and Cindy Torrence, who were both very helpful and understanding of student complaints. Again, leave any late night suggestions you may have below and I can bring them up in future meetings with Dining Services.¬†

As I type out this SGA Update, I see multiple Reddit posts appearing regarding an ongoing issue of no dining halls being open around campus currently. Dick has been in communication with the Chancellor about this issue and has stressed the negative impact it has on students, especially those that rely on swipes. Moving forward, alternatives are going to be considered to hopefully prevent this from occurring in the future. This topic will be expanded on in a later post, but that is all the information I currently have.

**SGA Spring 2022 Elections-** I spoke about SGA elections in my last SGA Update, but because voting occurs in less than a week, I wanted to remind everyone about the new voting system that SGA has decided on. SGA has decided to use rank choice voting (RCV) for a variety of reasons, but mainly to prevent runoff elections. In a traditional voting system which we have used, students select their favorite candidate and all the other candidates are just ignored on the ballot. If no candidate gets over fifty percent of votes in a single-seat election, there is a runoff between the top two candidates and voting needs to reoccur. Now, under RCV, voters rank the candidates in order of their favorability. The candidates with the least favorable votes are eliminated automatically and their votes are transferred to the voters next choice. I understand it can get confusing, and I may not have described it well; therefore, you can read more about [RCV here](https://www.fairvote.org/how_rcv_works). I also know there have been lots of people who are unsure about who to vote for in the Student Body President elections. As you might have seen in my former posts, I am working with Jeremiah Willaims and Abigail Warren on their campaign. If you want to read about them and their campaign you can check my former posts, which highlight their backgrounds, campaign platform, and policies. Jeremiah and I will also be working on Reddit to maintain the same level of communication that Dick has over his presidential term. Even if you do not decide to vote for the Williams/Warren ticket, I encourage you to cast your vote for whoever you think will do best in their respective positions. The higher voter turnout an election receives, the better representation SGA has.

I am very excited to see how this election turns out, no matter the results. I am also very thankful for Jeremiah Williams and Abigail Warren for giving me the opportunity to do what I love on Reddit while working alongside them. Also, since this is probably my second or to last SGA update for the month, I wanted to thank Dick for the amazing work he has done as Student Body President. He has left some very big shoes to fill. I also thank Dick again for being willing to work with me on these SGA Updates in the past. If you have any questions/concerns or you just want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out anytime via email at jmorr151@uncc.edu. I can also meet up in person for more prominent issues if necessary, I have a flexible schedule.¬†

Ready for some modern history? 

Tonight we'll be meeting in Denny 105 at 6:45pm to watch *The Social Network*. How was Facebook really founded? What was Mark Zuckerberg's reaction to the film? Is it too meta that we're posting to a college social page about a college student founding a social media platform? 

For answers to these questions and more (like how is Natalie Portman involved in all this?) come by later. 

And have a Happy Spring Break to All!

It disabled all power options on the computer. Attempting to power down from the start-menu resulted in  a ""There are no power options available"" message.

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,¬†

If you don‚Äôt know by now, I am Joe Morris and I am working with Jeremiah Williams and Abigail Warren for their campaign for Student Body President and Vice President. I‚Äôve taken the responsibility of updating y‚Äôall here on Reddit about the work done by them and the work done in SGA as a whole. As the campaign season quickly picks up speed, Jeremiah and Abigail wanted me to update y‚Äôall on how they intend to take on issues on campus. They have been talking with students consistently to ensure all issues are properly addressed, and here are three topics out of the many that they will work on:¬†

**Dining Improvements-** Because most dining options on campus close early, and all are closed by 11, a safety hazard is presented in the fact that hungry students must go off-campus at night to get access to food. The Williams-Warren ticket will ensure that hours for campus dining are longer to reduce this safety hazard and to allow students better access to food late at night. Along with this, they intend to expand food options and quality in dining halls and around campus as a while. They will stay in close contact with dining services and administration to raise food quality and keep this high quality throughout the year.¬†

**Costs of Attendance-** The Williams-Warren ticket hopes to lower the costs of attending UNC Charlotte in multiple ways. One way they intend to do so is by working with the Textbook Taskforce to make textbook prices more affordable. Kaitlyn Collins, the Chair of the Textbook Taskforce, has joined the Williams-Warren campaign staff and intends to work closely with the ticket to ensure students are saving as much money as possible on textbooks. Another way they hope to lower the cost of attendance is to work closely with PATS. Alongside PATS, Jeremiah and Abigail will work on parking costs and parking options. They will look at possible rideshare or carpool options to add alternatives to general parking passes provided currently. These are just two of many solutions to reduce the costs that students face in order to attend UNC Charlotte.

**Campus Accessibility-** Jeremiah and Abigail are both dedicated to making Charlotte more accessible and inclusive to everyone. Jeremiah is currently a member of the Campus Accessibility Accommodation Committee. Working alongside this committee, the ticket will increase disability services in classrooms and improve accessibility around campus for wheelchair access and safety.

As I mentioned in the beginning, this is only a small portion of the improvements that the Jeremiah Williams and Abigail Warren ticket will bring to the school. Along the campaign trail, I will continue to update y‚Äôall on more goals and commitments that this ticket has. If you look at my previous post, you can see why I decided to work with the Williams-Warren Campaign and why they would make an amazing Student Body President and Vice President. My previous posts show their background and their ‚ÄúTop 3‚Äù aspects that they bring along with them to every task they take on. I am very excited for the opportunity to work with them and to see the amazing work that they would get done if elected to the position. Feel free to leave any questions or comments below. Jeremiah and I will be active on Reddit to get back to y‚Äôall quickly. You can also read more about the ticket on their instagram page, WilliamsWarrenSBP.

Even enjoyed classes within my major. But now I am falling behind and don't care. I hate that I feel this way because it isn't me. It really sucks as well because I'm in some of my most important classes for my major right now. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm worried I may not pass some classes this semester and if that happens I think it would break me. I know the main response to this is going to refer me to caps which I will try and will myself into scheduling and appointment with them.

For a long while now I have also planned on moving into a graduate degree or some other form of higher education. With how I am feeling right now in regards to school I don't think I'll even be able to get through the first semester of a graduate program. I have also been thinking about coming back to school after a year or two to get a break from school and ""experience"" the real world.

Bottled-Bee,"In 2012 i graduated high school. I live in Gastonia so it kind of just made sense to get my 2year degree A.S. because I was the first group of high school students to do the college courses with Highschool. This covers all general education. I graduated with my associates in December 2017. 
I was pretty shit at learning and didn‚Äôt care.
In this time, 5 years for a 2 year degree,  I battled depression, my father mentally  and emotionally abused. Went through 2 abusive relationships. Stopped going to school. And I was having manic episodes so I thought but it really was just me. 
I wasted my FAFSA, I ended up in the hospital to get actual help and to figure out why I am working the way I was. I was diagnosed with Bipolar type 2. It took over 2 years to get my mix right to where I could confidently say I was comfortable. 
My now fianc√© helped me through it and I finally graduated. Woohoo‚Ä¶ 5 years for a 2 year degree. 

Since I was a child my dream was to move to Germany. Guess what? My fianc√© is German. Coincidence? Probably lol

I kicked myself into gear after visiting over summer. I decided then and there it was where I wanted to be. I applied to UNCC anxiety high, needing‚Ä¶ another medication. I was so thrilled when I got my acceptance letter. I was also very very scared. I started my year off very well and continued that way. About November I was having nightmares of hurting people and apparently there‚Äôs a OCD labeled Harm OCD. Again increase in medication. Because of my thoughts I couldn‚Äôt comfortably sit beside someone or be in a room with out crying because of my thoughts. It‚Äôs better now for sure.

Last week or week before my mom left but she got the mail first and ran inside holding this card and I made the deans list for the first time. I was so happy and I was proud.

I am posting this because I honestly want to hug every single one of you snuggly who are feeling horrible. 
I really didn‚Äôt post this for others to feel bad about me because I felt bad for myself long enough. I post this to let you all know it‚Äôs okay to feel how you are. It truly is, it shows that mentally you care about your well-being.

j0emorris,"After meeting with Jeremiah Williams and Abigail Warren over the weekend, I am even more confident in their ability to take on the role as Student Body President and Vice President. We discussed their platform and goals for the positions and I am here to give y‚Äôall a deeper dive into a few of their main plans. About a week ago, they posted their ‚ÄúTop Three‚Äù on Instagram. Those are as follows:

**Communication-** First and foremost, transparency and communication are central to the work we will do. Looking back at past student body elections and the incredibly low turnout, it is clear that many students lack a connection to SGA. How can we represent the student body if not all voices are being heard. To that end, we will continue and expand SGA presence on an array of social media (reddit, twitter, etc.), increase communication between administration and students through niner alerts, and make attempts to expand SGA‚Äôs reception to current student issues through a virtual suggestion box, town halls, and an ‚Äúopt-in‚Äù group messaging system (i.e. discord) so that more of our student body feels represented.

**Community-** Secondly, student issues remain at the forefront of our minds. After the massive setbacks students experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear students are craving connection and community with one another. As the pandemic slowly comes to a close, students will need advocates committed to maximizing the student experience while maintaining COVID-19 safety. Outside of COVID, we will establish a number of events to increase school spirit and keep campus life eventful on the weekends. To this end, we will maximize the use of the new student tailgating lot not only for sporting events, but for concerts and other community events. We want everyone to feel a massive connection to their Charlotte community.

**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion-** Thirdly, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are central to our platform. One major aspect of DEI is affordability. Students are overwhelmed with massive costs when attending college which makes an already stressful time even more tumultuous. To that end, we will continue the Campus Textbook Affordability Taskforce, advocate for alternative parking pass options, fight for student employee wage increases, and look for other ways to alleviate the burden on students. We recognize the intersection of marginalized identities that many Charlotte students find themselves in and will work to fight for these students and the unique issues they face- be it from economic status, mental wellness, race, gender identity, religion, etc.

These top three platform focus points would lead the Williams-Warren ticket to success in presidency and show that they have their finger on the pulse of student issues. Be on the lookout for upcoming posts that include more specific issues that the presidency plans on combatting. If you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below. Jeremiah and I are active on this Reddit page to bring you all the answers and solutions you seek quickly. You can find more information about the Williams-Warren ticket on their instagram, WilliamsWarrenSBP, or by reading my previous posts about their backgrounds.¬†

We want to see if anyone is willing or able to take over a lease for us to help us fix our rooming situation, but also to help whoever is in need of an apartment.

The 2 options are...

**A full lease takeover, meaning a 12 month lease. This would start in Fall of 2022 and end in Fall of 2023.** 

or

**A 2-month lease takeover for the Summer of 2023 (May 16th through Mid August) for anyone interested in having an apartment for summer school in Charlotte.**

Please reply to this post and lmk if you are interested in either of these options and we can exchange contact info and sort everything out.

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,

As I mentioned in my last SGA Update, I was not permitted to endorse or campaign for any candidates due to the Election Commision Act and my seat as Publicity and Outreach Chair. After consideration over the weekend and a conversation with Student Body President candidate Jeremiah Williams, I‚Äôve decided to step down from my position as Publicity and Outreach Chair in order to publicly support Jeremiah Williams and Abigail Warren who I believe would be a perfect pair for Student Body President and Vice President. During my conversation with Jeremiah, we discussed how Reddit would be handled under his presidency to ensure students have a direct pipeline to Jeremiah and the administration. If the Williams/Warren ticket wins, I would be responsible for maintaining the SGA Updates on Reddit as I have been doing. Along with that, we will both be active often on the Reddit page to ensure every comment and suggestion is heard and dealt with properly. To start off why I am choosing to support and work with Jeremiah and Abigail, I want to highlight their extensive history of putting students first.

**Jeremiah‚Äôs Background-** Jeremiah first joined Student Government in Spring of 2020. He immediately stepped into Vice Chair of Academic Affairs where he established the Academic Complaint Form and met with administration to propose several initiatives that reduced the stresses of the pandemic. He noticed that the pandemic and its effects would be long lasting. Working with Kaitlyn Collins, they proposed and passed legislation in support of Pass/No Credit options for the Fall of 2020 semester. Also as Vice Chair, he worked with Paula Keeton, the Director of Counseling and Psychological Services, and Kennith Smith, the University‚Äôs Budget Director to increase funding for free appointments with CAPS. Working with Jon Mitchell, Speaker of the Senate, and Dick Beekman, Jeremiah created the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee in SGA. When it was created, Jeremiah was elected to Chair of the DEI committee where he thrived and was eventually selected for Secretary of DEI under the Beekman-Hitchcock administration. He has continued his advocacy work on the Transfer and Non-Traditional Students Committee, the Chancellor‚Äôs Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, Chief Baker‚Äôs Police and Public Safety Advisory Board, and the Campus Accessibility Advisory Committee.

**Abigail‚Äôs Background-** Abigail joined Student Government in Fall of 2020. She stepped into the Vice Chair for Internal Affairs. In this position, she worked to make SGA run more efficiently and shift attention away from internal power issues and back towards advocacy. She also met with the University‚Äôs Health and Wellness Director to discuss how COVID was impacting campus and propose solutions. Alongside her work with the pandemic, served on a student panel for vaccinations. When the Beekman-Hitchcock administration started campaigning, she worked with them and was given the Attorney General position. As Attorney General, her responsibilities were to run elections and participate in outreach with students. She also would interact and hear from groups and organizations that SGA did not contact often. Abigail did a phenomenal job running the Fall 2021 elections and broke the candidate turnout record.

The work Jeremiah and Abigail have done in the past prove to me that the Williams/Warren ticket would be more than successful as Student Body President and Vice President. I am meeting with Jeremiah and Abigail this weekend to write out a post stating their platform and goals clearly. Until then, you can check out their Instagram, williamswarrenSBP, where you can also visit their website. On both of these, you can read more about their proven commitment to their word and their campaign platform and goals. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them below. Both Jeremiah and myself will be working strongly to build a similar connection with Reddit to the standard Dick has set.¬†

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,

I hope this finds you well. For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is the Chair of the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y‚Äôall on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.

**Parking and Transportation Updates-** About a week ago on Reddit, multiple posts were made regarding traffic buildup as a result of bus drivers changing shifts and the buses backing up. Personally, I have been using the bus multiple times during the drivers shift changes and I can vouch for the fact that it creates a major time inconvenience that is unexpected. After hearing these complaints along with others, myself, Senator Jeremy Yagoda, and SBP Dick Beekman met with Doug Lape, Director of PATS, and Michael Christenbury, Vice Director for Transportation. In this meeting, we discussed possible solutions to the time inconsistency provided by the bus drivers changing. There are a lot of boxes to check by the bus drivers when changing shifts, so it is difficult to speed them up when changing drivers. Along with this, the period in which they change shifts is about two hours, because they don‚Äôt all change at once, making it very difficult to show a schedule of these shift changes on something like the NinerTransit mobile app. The conclusion that we came to is to ensure that bus drivers do not change during class change times. This should cut down on car traffic as well, as most of this traffic occurs during these class changing times.¬†

Along with this, I had heard complaints in regards to transportation provided to and from Greek Village. Currently, there is no transportation provided by the University to or from Greek Village. Because of the long walk and early sunsets, this creates a major safety issue and a major inconvenience for those who live in Greek Village. Doug Lape was very much in support of solving this problem, however, because of the staffing issue we face, we must wait to implement increased transportation into that area. One immediate solution we could see is more bikes and scooters present in that area. Once staffing increases, there are multiple solutions with possibilities including an on demand service, or an extra shuttle route that goes into Greek Village. In order to increase the likelihood of a solution, even if it is when staffing increases, SGA passed the Greek Village Transportation Act. This act thanks Doug Lape and Michael Christenbury for their works and states that SGA supports the solutions provided. Doug Lape and Michael Christenbury were both very supportive of all the suggestions we presented so I thank them for their work.

**Spring 2022 SGA Elections-** Before I discuss anything related to this election cycle, I would like to preface by saying that I am not allowed to publicly endorse or support any candidate because of my position as Publicity and Outreach Chair. This is because of the Elections Commission Act which is new for this election and affects the campaigning ability of those who are on the Elections Commission. Instead of telling you about candidates, I am using this opportunity to discuss with y‚Äôall the new voting system that will be used during this election cycle. SGA has decided to use rank choice voting (RCV) for a variety of reasons, but mainly to prevent runoff elections. In a traditional voting system which we have used, students select their favorite candidate and all the other candidates are just ignored on the ballot. If no candidate gets over fifty percent of votes in a single-seat election, there is a runoff between the top two candidates and voting needs to reoccur. Now, under RCV, voters rank the candidates in order of their favorability. The candidates with the least favorable votes are eliminated automatically and their votes are transferred to the voters next choice. I understand it can get confusing, and I may not have described it well; therefore, you can read more about [RCV here.](https://www.fairvote.org/how_rcv_works) 

**Dining Hall Vegan and Vegetarian Options-** There has been ongoing complaints regarding the dining options and the lack of vegan,vegetarian, and pescetarian options. Because of this Senator Ronni Lilly met with the administration of dining and food services and they came to the resolution to increase the amount of vegan and vegetarian food options by having meatless burritos and tacos once a week. And in order to increase the frequency of meals like this, dining services want to see numbers of the people who are affected by a lack of these food options. If you are affected please fill out [this survey.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8jpRDEPHaUQCHGxXdG1yr8HMpq-e7JXjPeaH5jX9AZVH6pw/viewform?usp=sf_link) The survey results will be used to determine if dining services should increase any specific food options.¬†

As election season kicks off, I intend to get involved whether that means I have to step down as Publicity and Outreach Chair or just do behind the scenes work. Either way, I‚Äôm very excited to see the outcomes and how this election cycle goes. I will continue to do my best in ensuring every student has their voice heard. If you have any questions/concerns or you just want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out anytime via email at jmorr151@uncc.edu. I can also meet up in person for more prominent issues if necessary, I have a flexible schedule.

tatiyanatifesbp,"**Hello Everyone! Today we're happy to announce that Tatiyana Larson and Tife Olusesi are running for Student Body President and Vice President!**

We're running together because we believe that the whole community here at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, can Thrive Together. Every student voice and concern should be listened to and addressed. Niner Nation is stronger when we all work together.  To achieve this we have centered our platform around these three pillars.

**Progress-** Tangible action-based plans are necessary in order to make any progress. We have a progressive mindset that each obstacle can be overcome so long as we dedicate our time to analyze the situation, and push ourselves to make active changes that will ultimately create a better college experience.

**Unity-** College students have been going through a very uncertain time over the past few years which is why we will provide a united front in combating our daily struggles and make the changes necessary to develop a stronger community. We want to emphasize the importance of creating a safe and diverse space while aiming our focus on mental health. With this in mind, we believe students should join us in developing an inclusive community that we all wish to be part of.

**Trust-** We believe establishing trust is founded upon transparency and open communication. Our administration would focus immensely on communicating actively with the student body and its leaders. With this, we hope to gain your trust in our decision-making as we continuously navigate how to best represent each and every student, every single time.

We understand that this relationship of Progress, Unity, and Trust has to be earned and that if elected, we need to push policies that benefit the whole student body. Here's a glimpse at our the policies we feel are the most important. Please check out our instagram: **@ Tatiyana.tife.** Where we will be constantly updating our pubs, campaign platform, and getting to know the members of our community even better. 

**Diversity-** Directly providing platforms and spaces for BIPOC communities to express concerns and grievances. This will include creating an inclusive safe space for BIPOC students as well as creating a more accessible and comfortable Lavender Lounge.

**Academics-**  Pushing for Non- -Mandatory Attendance policies in order for students to have more flexibility in deciding time commitments and prioritizing their mental health. 

**Student Affairs-** Working with on-campus organizations to create engaging and memorable students activities, concerts, shows, and events.

Hi Y'all!

We hope your semesters are going well! You're invited to the History Club tonight as we watch ""Bridge of Spies,"" a movie based on a true story of the Cold War when a New York lawyer is tasked by the CIA to negotiate with the Soviet Union the release of a U.S. U-2 spy plane pilot in exchange for the same Soviet spy the lawyer defended in court. 

We'll be meeting in Denny 105 at 6:45pm tonight! If you have any questions, post below or email at [uncc.historyclub@gmail.com](mailto:uncc.historyclub@gmail.com).

a-aron087,"My fiance is a math major in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. She's always had trouble taking tests and this semester is no exception. Needless to say she failed her first test in one of her classes. No big deal, it's only the first test, she can make it up with the next ones and learn from her mistakes as long as she works with the professor. However, the professor made it very clear to the class today that ""if you made below a 40 on this test, you should and need to drop the class. There is nothing I can do for you."" 

He continued by saying that he doesn't feel bad for those that failed because they ""don't give a crap."" Now, I understand that it may be true that if they failed the first test then there is no way to get a passing grade (not exactly sure for this particular class but I know there are situations where it is possible). However, professors are supposed to be there for our success and an attitude like that is not only unprofessional but downright malicious. Essentially her professor has made himself unapproachable in terms of getting the help his students may need. 

My question is, who does she talk to about this? The professor has made it quite obvious that he has no interest in being a source of help, nor does he feel that he can be. I feel like the dean of CLAS is a bit too high on the administrative ladder, given that she oversees a wide variety of programs, to be the best point of contact.

We‚Äôre spending money to have our time wasted. I‚Äôm not even working a job and CS homework eats up every bit of my free time (weekends included). 

Of course, these classes (2600/3688/1600) always have draconian attendance policies, so you risk your grade if you decide to skip when you have something pressing like a coding project or an exam to study for.

It‚Äôs especially insulting to be sitting through the class only to have a guest speaker tell you that you have too much free time and that employers will throw out your resume if you don‚Äôt join some club or student organization. (Yes, this was actually said in one of my classes.)

happyhornetsfan,"I just graduated with a degree in computer science and I wanted to give y'all my schpeel about vitamin D deficiency, I am not a doctor and don't take this as medical advice however I feel that the user-base who browses reddit is probably a bit more at risk for this than the average population.   


Even in the average population vitamin D deficiency is around 42%, this can cause lacking of energy, depression, and pretty severe anxiety. I was getting pretty sick every winter with really bad panic attacks, depression, and it got even worse during covid. My dishes would stack up in the sink and I would avoid socializing due to my anxiety. I was active and I would go play basketball at UREC and go to the gym, so it did not even cross my mind that I could be deficient in Vitamin D which is fundamental for nervous system and bone health. I thought that it was for shut-ins (even though I pretty much was one). It got to the point where I was near suicidal on several occasions, I dropped all of my classes multiple times and due to my pride would not get help.   


It got to the point where I started getting really bad migraines so I got blood work done trying to figure out what was causing them, and I was tested for my vitamin D levels. Mine were REALLY low and within 1 week of starting to take new supplements again, about 80% of all mental health problems I have ever had are gone and I mean GONE.   


This was actually a really big problem before the pandemic, and if any of you guys are suffering like I was it is I hope it is at least worth the PSA to ask you guys if you are depressed or anxious to go to the doctor and get it checked, it is probably the fastest and easiest fix for your health and yet it is still such a large problem.",UNCCharlotte,Vitamin D Deficiency - PSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/sk2mqx/vitamin_d_deficiency_psa/,sk2mqx,8,9,"02/03/2022, 22:11:06"

Jard413,"I have some things that I have issue with on campus that I feel don‚Äôt get addressed enough so I decided to do so myself. This is gonna be a little lengthy so please read if you can and lmk your thoughts.


Firstly, UREC. I think the facility is amazing and has phenomenal equipment but that‚Äôs simply not worth it when a workout takes 3 hours to complete because I wait 20 min for every piece of equipment. The facility is simply not big enough, I understand it‚Äôs new and maybe it was big enough at the time of being built but the school has been rapidly growing in the past few years and this is something that should have been foreseen. Not once have I left the gym here feeling like I got in a true workout because I don‚Äôt, there is no possible way to do any sort of intense 
training with having to wait at least 20 min for a bench or rack. Because of the wait times and inability to get a true workout I haven't even been able to go recently, I don't have the time and when I am able to make time I just feel like I've wasted precious hours in the day that could've been used to do get work done or anything else that I see and feel results from (This isn't like a ""I worked out for a week and I'm not shredded"" type of feeling, I don't even feel like I just left the gym or worked out at all). To wrap this up it doesn‚Äôt matter how nice or new UREC is, it‚Äôs simply not enough for a school with a student body of 30,000+.

Second, Crown/SoVi. Im a first year student so I can't speak on the dining halls of the past but what I've seen this past year has infuriated me. I try to hit crown at least three times a day in-between classes or doing schoolwork, the food is fucking awful but I have mindset of ""this shit is so expensive, I don't care if its inedible, I'm going to find a way to choke it down"". I live on campus so I'm required to get a meal plan, I was ok with this until I got to campus last fall. (Most of this is my experience with crown as I rarely go to SoVi) After about a month there was no silverware, lack of seating, and my digestive track went on a rollercoaster ride like nothing I've experienced before. I don't know if you've ever been butt ass naked asking God to just let it end, all while on a foreign shitter your first week away from home, but it is not an experience I recommend. I understand there is a labor shortage right now but there is absolutely no excuse for the food quality we get at the cost, I've seen countless posts of raw chicken at SoVi or just food that would send most to the hospital or bathroom sick as hell after eating it. At crown I've found one of the easiest things to get down is the pizza, if you've never had crown pizza the best way to describe it is toast that sat in grease for a week and a little cheese sprinkled on top, make sure you don't look at the bottom of your piece as it is solid black 75% of the time. Not a week ago I got a piece for lunch and as soon as I bit into it, it literally squirted grease across the table onto my friend and all over me. I came back to campus for the two weeks online as it is near impossible for me to successfully do school while home, I ate Wendys and Bojangles using DB for most of the first week then I found out I would get some money back if I avoiding the dinning halls completely for the rest of the time, Crown was closed during this time (An issue in itself) so I figured why not, I can survive on fast food for two weeks right? I got through the two weeks fine and the other day I got an email that id get some money back, dope right? Nah, I'm getting it back in DB, pretty bummed about this but whatever, I'll use it. What my real issue with this is, is the amount I'm getting back, $199.53. What The Fuck. I figured that id at least get an appropriate amount and if you can't tell I'm not very happy about this. Using Crown2Go a meal comes out to about $10, I eat three times a day and I moved in on the 8th, the last day of move in for those coming back before online was up. So 3 meals a day for 14 days at $10 a meal, $420. This might not seem like a big difference but to me it is, what makes my money worth less than anyone else that would pay for these meals, why do I pay so much money for this God awful food and can even get properly reimbursed for it? I think I'm gonna finish my dining hall rant here as I feel like I'm just going on and on now, if you eat at crown my biggest advice is to get the wraps, its the only thing that won't tear your stomach apart and one of the women that makes them is the nicest employee in there, most others are rude asf. Sorry if this part sounded a bit bitchy, if you can't tell I'm a little emotional on this topic and frankly I feel that the quality of food on campus nowhere near reflects the cost.

Third and lastly, Campus Parking. I'll make this one quick so if you're still reading don't worry, we're almost done. I understand that parking is limited and its first come first serve but damn, you'd think id at least be able to get a spot somewhat close to my dorm. This is another thing that rubs me the wrong way due to price, I'm paying damn near $500 a year just to not get a spot anywhere even close to where I live. I believe this is another issue with underestimating the size of the student body, when the university sees they are going through explosive growth why don't they make preparations? And to students that live on campus, if you know you're not gonna use your car for weeks please just park in a deck. The lots in front of dorms are gonna be put too much better use by those that actually use their vehicles on a frequent basis.

I think I'm gonna cap this off here, however, I want to be very clear on this last part. I truly do enjoy being a student at this school and by no means do I think it is a bad school, but, I truly wish that the amenities and services on campus would reflect the cost. By no means do I come from a wealthy family and it took a lot of thought to decide if school was worth the cost for me, I'm going to spend a significant part of my life in debt to this school and I truly wish that I felt it was worth it but right now I simply don't. That might not be the right way to phrase it, I believe the degree is worth it but I'm currently paying for much more than a degree and I'm somewhat disappointed in what I've gotten so far. Easily one of the best parts of this campus is something I'm not even paying for, our student body president, he does an incredible job of looking out for the student body and I'm going to be sad to see him leave this spring. I hope this post make some impact and I see changes at this school while I'm here or in the years after I leave. If you're planning on applying to this school please don't let this post deter you, UNCC truly is a great school and I love it. If you are coming here, just know these issues and prepare for them in whatever way that is.",UNCCharlotte,"Rant (Ik its long, please read if you can)",https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/siwgr9/rant_ik_its_long_please_read_if_you_can/,siwgr9,21,19,"02/02/2022, 13:49:32"

New-Calendar2465,"Hello and welcome to r/UNCCharlotte for those who have been accepted in to UNC Charlotte or are investigating Charlotte as a choice of school. The Niner community warmly welcomes you no matter who you are.  


This post is here to aid you with personal perspective in your decision of which college you would like to attend. I hope you learn something new about UNC Charlotte if you are already an active student.  


I will begin with UNC Charlotte's strengths and then roll into the schools weaknesses in no specific order. It is important to realize that some aspects of this school will play as a plus for people in one situation, and a minus for others. Please be respectful of those who do not share the same background as you- not everyone has access to the same resources growing up. **I try to be fair with my assessments below however I do acknowledge that I do face inextricable bias.**

&amp;#x200B;

**UNC Charlotte strength's:**

Lets start of with UNC Charlotte's recent [unprecedented growth](https://www.northcarolina.edu/institutions-and-affiliates/university-of-north-carolina-charlotte-five-year-goals-and-associated-benchmarks/) as a University:

* enrollment has jumped 33% in just 10 years. UNC Charlotte has the second highest enrollment in the entire UNC system with more than 30k students (NCSU has around 35k and excel in everything STEM)
* The Charlotte metro is one of the [fastest growing MSAs](https://www.charlottestories.com/heres-charlotte-became-fastest-growing-city-country-past-decade/) in the entire United States 
* Research output has doubled in 10 years. The school is R2 right now (high research activity) and we will be R1 (very high research activity) in a few years putting us in the same classification as the top Universities around the US

&amp;#x200B;

**Location** \- [Campus](https://www.youvisit.com/tour/unccharlotte?pl=v) is massive and beautiful. We have a 1,000 acre campus and a little over half has been built on. This is one of the ways that it helps to attend a relatively newer institution. UNCC was started in 1946, most of our buildings were built in the 70s-90s. There are major renovations and new buildings being built every single years. It is very easy to walk, bike, and board anywhere on campus (sorry Engineers y'all just gotta walk bike and board farther)

**The City of Charlotte is a 20 minute** [train ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAEKConWKU0&amp;ab_channel=UNCCharlotte%27sOfficialYouTubeChannel) **away -** okay 20 minutes is longer than I want it to be but can you beat a free ride from campus to the city and back? Have you even been to downtown Raleigh/Durham? Charlotte &gt; RDU. Access to uptown jobs and nightlife is at your finger tips.     


**UNCC can be a very low cost option for many people** \- Self explanatory. We are already known as a commuter school and receive praise every year for enrolling a record amount of low income and underrepresented minority students. However there is a new massive apartment complex built every single year. source  


**Diversity** \- We are one of the state leaders in first generation students and rank high in social mobility.  


**Our Rebranding** \- The school is actively going through a [rebranding](https://inside.charlotte.edu/news-features/2021-08-19/hi-we%E2%80%99re-charlotte-nice-meet-you) phase to align more with the top institutions within the UNC system and surrounding area. New name, new logo, new perception. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Great Jobs after graduation -** Our [computer science program](https://cci.charlotte.edu/departments/cci-departments) is by far the largest in the state. It is respected by other universities but I would not say that it is 'better'. Same goes for [Engineering](https://engr.charlotte.edu/) \- very respectable program yet has not surpassed the likes of NCSU. [Nursing](https://nursing.charlotte.edu/) and [Education](https://education.charlotte.edu/) programs are highly respected among employers (seriously google how much a travel nurse makes). [Belk College of Business](https://belkcollege.charlotte.edu/) also has great connections to the uptown banks and beyond. We are not known for being a good pre-med school. Pre-law is highly dependent on your GPA and LSAT so choose an easy relevant major and bang out that LSAT baby. UNC Charlotte seems to be leading the charge in the highly lucrative [Data Science](https://datascience.charlotte.edu/) field. UNC Charlotte is making a concerted effort to be on the cutting edge of computation and energy production.

**Sports -** we have always nationally ranked and respected at soccer and baseball. Our football team has been underwhelming, yet Charlotte and its students both show great attention and commitment to seeing this program grow. We have a basketball team but their interest in attending games has been low. Rugby and hockey recreation teams have each won championships in recent years.  


**Uptown and Graduate Degrees** \- If you work uptown and want to obtain a graduate degree part time and in person, your options are UNCC, WF (high tuition), and USC charlotte location. UNCC has the most resources available to students given it's 11 story [uptown campus](https://duboiscenter.charlotte.edu/) located within the i-277.

&amp;#x200B;

**UNC Charlotte's weaknesses:** 

  
**""The back up school""** \- Commonly we are referred to as a back up school- and to a point it is true. I have met students who were capable of attending Ivy Leagues and other very respectable institutions but prefer Charlotte for their reasons, and I have also met some dimwits who make me wonder how they ever found their way on to a campus - the gamete runs wide. Charlotte being a back up school allowed me the opportunity to figure out what direction I wanted to take with my life. Who knows where I would have ended up had I gone to App State.

**UNC Charlotte is not ""UNC, Duke, NCSU, Wake etc.""** and you know what we will **never** be these institutions and **that is okay!** We cater to different demographics and we have our **own strengths**. They have been long established way before UNC Charlotte came along. It is our responsibility to shape our own reputation and carve out our niche in the market. Believe it or not but those schools have weaknesses of their own and it is a newer institution like UNC Charlotte that can respond to the changes with better agility.  

**We are not the research triangle -** UNC, Duke, and NCSU benefit from the advantage of being approximately located near one another which allows for more cooperation and competition among those institutions. UNC Charlotte almost stands alone in the Charlotte region with less access to the same pools of professor talent and job market prospects. This however provides UNC Charlotte with a greater advantage with more proximate employers just miles away like Bank of America, Lowes, Wells Fargo, Duke Power, and Honeywell who hire UNCC engineers, developers, and leaders every single day.  


**We will never have a med school or law school** \- technically this is just my opinion, but what I understand about these types of programs is that their success and prestige is highly dependent on reputation. Wake Forest is making a med school branch in Charlotte anyway.

**Location-** The Charlotte main campus is pretty much in a low desirability area, and a little far of a drive from the city. We get clowned on for being ""UNC-Concord"" lol but can you beat paying $400 or sometimes less in rent?? It is a give and a take situation. Just avoid the Walmart of North Tryon. The University plans on attracting employers to the University area and investments on the light rail leading to campus which is already happening. Note: **Campus is built like an island so foot traffic moves fluidly and vehicle traffic is often a pain in the butt.**

**Social scene** \- can be boring at times, this is changing with the one new luxury student apartment that is built every single year on University City Blvd. Greek life is meh. I remedied this by finding a super solid group of friends - we did everything under the sun from tailgates to taking road trips.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**All in all**: Charlotte is a great school that comes from humble beginnings that still has massive room for growth potential. If you can see yourself in an environment built for shaping what is next then Charlotte is the right place for you. If you prefer an institution where the reputation precedes you then  Charlotte might not be the right fit, yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit about my UNC Charlotte experience: I started at UNC Charlotte in 2014 studying Exercise Science. I eventually transferred out of that major because the competition for the limited spots in upper division is fierce and I did not care for the career prospects. I switched to business and found my passion for Economics, in which I eventually graduated with my bachelors of science. I am now a student in the masters of Economics at UNCC. I loved attending UNC Charlotte and I had the absolute time of my life. I made to many great friends that I still hang out with to this day. I would not trade my experience at UNCC for an experience at any other school (although I bet University of Southern California woulda been lit). **I will graduate from both of these degrees debt free with money in the bank due to the fact I am able to commute from my family home and also work at the same time.**   


  
**Most importantly**: where you go to college does not have that big of an impact on your life, seriously. A person may use their college experience to shape the rest of their life using the experiences that they established in this time. But really, no one gives a single shit where you went to college after you get 2-3 years of work experience. No matter where you go just ***find some good friends and create your own opportunities.***

obviouslypretty,"I will admit, I was never a huge fan of mobile ordering for ANY restaurant on campus. I felt it created unnecessary stress on workers and made overall service slower. However, I‚Äôm just now starting to realize the convenience of it. 

The ability to grab your food and keep walking makes it extremely easier to squeeze in a meal before work or sitting down the study. It seems like with the limited hours of a lot of places on campus, it makes it a hassle to get anything else other than dining hall food. Especially if you are stuck on campus.

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,

I hope this finds you well. For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is the Chair of the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y‚Äôall on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.

**Open Letter to Faculty Council-** For those of you who might have missed it, the Student Body President Dick Beekman recently released an open letter to the Faculty Council President. This letter urges professors to increase leniency regarding attendance policies, create flexible deadlines, and allow students the ability to record classroom lectures. This would prevent students from letting academic needs interfere with the health of themselves and their community. The Faculty Council heard from Dick last Thursday, during which the open letter was brought up. The letter was well received and supported by the Provost and the Faculty Council President, and the hope is that the message was passed along throughout the faculty. Along with this, Dick has sent the message to Chancellor Gaber and the Board of Trustees in hopes of gaining more support. I know there is a relatively polarizing debate regarding if our semester should be in person or online. As the school is committed to maintaining an in person semester, it should be noted that SGA is and has been advocating for policies that maximize our ability to have a safe semester.

**Student Tailgate Area-** As you all are just finding out, Charlotte has recently received a 10 million dollar donation in order to build a brand new student tailgating area. One of the most consistent complaints from students heard by SGA was the lack of a permanent tailgating area. SGA has repeatedly looked for solutions to this issue, but this generous gift allows us to meet this large request. The tailgate area will be located next to the Motorsports Lab, which is right behind the football stadium. This provides an extremely close and convenient location for students to tailgate. The area will be three acres large including an 8,000 square foot entertainment pavilion. Alongside the pavilion there will be a manicured lawn with permanent restroom facilities and various power sources. Because of the large land area and pavilion, you can expect the area to be used throughout the year for much more than just tailgating. Personally, I am excited about the new tailgate area because the favorable location should increase student involvement at football games. Aside from this, I am eager to see what events and activities arise throughout the year as a result of the location.

**Canvas Photos-** Many of you have expressed frustrations repeatedly regarding Canvas reverting uploaded photos back to student ID pictures. SGA has been very involved in this process in order to obtain information on what the issue is and any possible solutions. When the university decided to change Canvas photos to student ID pictures, it was understood that throughout the process students would have the ability to change their photos if they desired. However, because of the add/drop period for classes, Canvas would refresh daily in order to update class rosters. As the add/drop period is now over, Canvas now refreshes their roster weekly. This is an issue for Canvas photos because when Canvas refreshes, it resets the photos to the default, which is student ID pictures. SGA has been engaged in conversations with IT, Academic Affairs, and the Chief Diversity Officer to find a solution. While discussions continue to be had on this topic, please know that SGA is aware of your concerns and frustrations and is actively advocating on your behalf.¬†

As this is my first Reddit post back for the semester, I cannot wait to see what this semester brings for Charlotte. I am excited to keep providing y‚Äôall with updates about what work is being done within SGA. I will continue to do my best in ensuring every student has their voice heard. I hope everyone is having a great beginning to their semester, and is staying safe with the recent wintery weather.

UNC Charlotte Dining and off-campus places have very similar health inspection violations which are similar to what I have seen in other counties when I have looked.  These health inspections only give a snapshot of once a year when the inspector comes, but I hope these facts will be helpful to you and help you feel as safe dining on campus as you feel dining off campus.

ilikecacti2,"I commented on someone else‚Äôs post but I felt I should make this it‚Äôs own post. With the pandemic staffing shortages and whatever other excuses they come up with, food safety at chartwells has completely plummeted. 

I‚Äôve seen raw pizza dough, raw chicken, rotten potatoes, plus the huge issue with rotten fruit everyone here last semester is probably familiar with, and I only used about 30 swipes last semester and that‚Äôs all I saw. Today someone said their pasta tasted contaminated. 

Not to mention that towards the end of last semester the dining area in Crown had a possible outbreak of serratia marcessens (that‚Äôs the pink bacteria we have in North Carolina that grows on stuff for those who don‚Äôt know) and they did nothing, you could just see it on stuff. 

I know that it‚Äôs not practical for many of us to avoid the dining halls completely since we are required to buy a dining plan if we live on campus, and then that takes up a big chunk of our food budget. But just be aware when you get your food. If it looks, tastes, or smells off, don‚Äôt eat it. 

*I realize that the serratia marcessens thing is probably a serious allegation. And yeah it‚Äôs not like I had it tested.

I ask that you remember that the university community is made up of more than just young and healthy students. Some of us are in groups where even omicron poses a significant risk. Please don't be the one that gives it to us. 

We're here 40 or more hours a week trying to keep this school running for the students. Custodians, food service, admins, librarians, facilities staff are all important to this community. Some of us are elderly, immunocompromised, or disabled. Some of us live with elderly, immunocompromised, or disabled family at home.

Many students want (and deserve) the 'normal' college experience. I completely get that. None of us are thrilled with this experience either. But *please* remember that few of us have the ability to choose to work from home. Few of us have the financial freedom to quit when things get dangerous. We're basically stuck in here with you. 

We have to deal with the choices you make, whether that's going unmasked, throwing a rager off campus, or refusing to get vaccinated. When you take risks because you aren't worried, you put someone at risk who should be worried.

And not all staff care, I know. I see some employees with their stupid noses out of their stupid mask, too.

She told me later today that she was identified through waste water testing. I remember last year that they isolated the entire building and you couldn't leave until you got a negative test. I am angry because the university seems to care about COVID with the weekly mitigation testing and yet they are allowing possibly positive students to go to class? 

Another friend of mine had COVID and was severely ill. Five days after she was quarantined, they asked if she had any symptoms and she replied, ""Yes,"" (the symptom was only a runny nose, but still) and told her to just wear a mask around people. Does the university actually care about students?

_FulvousFox_,"As someone who has been going back and forth with Student Health for about two semesters now I have learned that whatever this campus sees as ""held together"" is more or less jamming staples into something and hoping it maintains itself.

I am currently COVID positive. 

No clue when I came into contact as my entire family has it and our household is a desperate mess of sickness. I have no clue how long the effects will be persisting or what changes will come with each day. Only now are my symptoms beginning to subside but I am still positive according to my tests.

To run down how much of a disaster this has been:

1) Approaching Student Health with a positive test only leant me two phone calls where I described my symptoms and was told to stay quarantined for an indeterminate amount of time (as I have no clue when my sickness actually began). I objectively have no idea when I am expected to come back especially with some of my symptoms persisting. 

2) No paperwork has been required on my end according to the health services as they ""just trust me"". Meaning my health entry is functioning off some system of valor rather than confirmed documentation from a health provider. No clue why this is a thing, especially when the health center has required paperwork for lesser claims.

3) Despite the health center *encouraging* me to forward my positive diagnosis email to my professors they have still decided that, for some reason, how my absence is handled is up to my teachers. Meaning that, despite the emails, phone calls, forms and doctor's visits, that my professors can either punish me still or will need further paperwork. Why something like this isn't a clean-cut email that can't be refuted is beyond me.

4) Now that I am needing paperwork for the *one* teacher who needs it I am reaching out through the absentee verification form. Why this isn't the form that was needed from the start instead of the health center survey is another thing that baffles me. According to the form, this will also take weeks to get feedback on with the risk of being rejected if the center does not agree with my appeal.

Essentially my situation has been that:

*I have COVID, no clue when contact came in or when it started/will end. The student survey via our email was apparently enough for them to claim quarantine, but when they want me back has not been clear. Despite being positive and having word from the health center to stay put I am having to communicate manually with all my professors and hope they are all willing to cooperate with me. IF they don't, I will likely have to come in despite having COVID and being ill. Extra forms are being layered over this in order to further confirm my absences despite being told from the start that the phone calls and original survey were enough.*

I will very much likely just have to attend deathly sick as I cannot keep playing this game of show pony and hoping that I don't get punished academically.

The fact any of this is in place the way it is, is just pathetic and confusing. Either just tell students to come in sick no matter what, kill us if you need to, or actually have a system in place that makes sense and keeps students healthy.",UNCCharlotte,The way this campus handles COVID is a joke,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/scmlfe/the_way_this_campus_handles_covid_is_a_joke/,scmlfe,80,28,"01/25/2022, 15:06:40"

I swear this is my last post about this project. Promise. 

If anyone is interested in participating in a 10-week online meditation course (run through Canvas) designed to teach you how to meditate, encourage weekly reflection, and decrease some of the negative health effects the pandemic has had on us, take a look at the info flyer attached! 

If you're definitely interested in enrolling in the course, you can read and sign an informed consent document [here](https://powerforms.docusign.net/e29b09f9-5173-4773-afde-85605d4aef9d?env=na3&amp;acct=0ca3ad84-b01e-4858-bcdb-17ba8f48a133&amp;accountId=0ca3ad84-b01e-4858-bcdb-17ba8f48a133&amp;recipientLang=en).

Because of this, several classes like german and english were failed just because the teacher I was assigned did not know how to do them from home and the grades from the rest of the classes weren't all to great either. I ended up coming back my senior year, I was doing good, until COVID hit, Everything went online, got laid off from my job, my mental health had really never been lower and because of that and me not being a great online learner, partially because of ADHD, I again suffered from awful grades. However I kept going and managed to graduate. Afterwords I enrolled in community and learned it was online again, same mental health spiral took place and i finished fall 2020 with a gpa under 1. I decided to take a year off, work on myself, get more self disciplined and come back, which I did.

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. With a decision being made regarding omicron and the remainder of our semester, I wanted to come on here and provide some more information regarding the decision and our next steps moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

As you know from today's announcement, the school has decided to move forward with in-person instruction on the 24th. I want to emphasize that this decision was not made lightly. This decision was made only after careful consideration of the current COVID situation in the surrounding area as well as UNC Charlotte's logistical capabilities and repeated conversations with public health officials and System Office personnel. Ultimately, it was decided that by the 24th we will be in a position where we can return to in-person instruction with a reasonable expectation that we can manage the omicron situation.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few specific factors as it relates to this decision that I wanted to share with you. County health officials we've consulted with believe we hit our local peak as early as this week, with some even believing we hit it on January 10th (it should be noted that while the CDC considers the nationwide peak to be later this month, individual communities are going to have different time frames). While only four days ago, publicly available data seems supportive of this assessment. With still a week to further the distance between us and the peak, this is cause for optimism. Furthermore, the fact that January 24th is significantly removed from holiday travel further bolsters beliefs that we will be able to successfully avoid the brunt of this wave. It was decided to announce this decision now so that students had ample time prior to the add/drop deadline to make a well informed decision as to their class schedule as we move into this next phase.

&amp;#x200B;

There are additional measures the University is taking to help mitigate risk of spread over the next few weeks. The school has ordered 100,000 masks of a higher quality than the traditional masks that have been common throughout this pandemic. The quality of these masks are in line with an expected CDC announcement on updated guidance surrounding appropriate masks to mitigate the spread of omicron. These masks will be free for students and will be distributed during our return to campus. Furthermore, the school will be instituting restrictions on the size of events (30 people indoors, 50 outdoors) with the intention of cutting back on non-essential potential super spreader events until numbers further subside. While frustrating from a social perspective, this is an important step to allow us to avoid situations such as the current crisis at NC State, where massive outbreaks have resulted in zero available quarantine space for students. Additionally, ongoing mitigation testing, robust contact tracing, and wastewater testing will continue to allow us to quickly identify and contain potential outbreaks, perhaps more important than ever when considering the transmissibility of omicron.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be clear, students will test positive. Outbreaks will occur, and we will likely see spikes. This is to be expected in a global pandemic. I say this not to alarm any members of the community, but rather prepare you for what we know to be the reality of the situation. This decision is not about the complete elimination of risk. This decision is about mitigating the risk in a manner where we feel confident we can properly handle and address any issues that arise throughout the semester. We are on the tail end of a wave, and we know waves do not last forever. With careful and proactive mitigation efforts, we can provide in-person instruction while providing the support and resources needed to confront this pandemic head on in a successful manner.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the remainder of the semester, while we have learned there are no absolutes in this pandemic, the intention is that we will remain in person throughout the remainder of the semester. The expectation is that barring the emergence of unforeseen strains we will return to ""normal."" I have spoken with Chancellor Gaber regarding Spring Break, and have received assurances that it will remain unchanged, with the likely decision that we will incorporate some sort of reentry testing to proactively prevent bringing COVID back to the community. Graduation is also expected to remain an in-person event, and I know graduating seniors will appreciate hearing that. Of course, I need to emphasize that as we have seen throughout this pandemic, unforeseen situations develop, and without a crystal ball, there can be no guarantees. Having said that, assuming no new variants pop up, I find it difficult to imagine a scenario in which these plans are derailed.

&amp;#x200B;

These are difficult decisions being made in difficult times, however I'm much more confident with us attempting an in-person start now than I would have been on January 10th. As we progress through these next few days and weeks, I will do my best to keep you all up to date with any new developments that may occur. Should you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to comment below and I will try my best to get to them as quickly as I can.

Hey guys,

So after realizing that I won‚Äôt really have any leeway in my on campus housing for spring semester because I didn‚Äôt know my decision until the 23rd of December (I‚Äôm a transfer, some complex circumstances), I can‚Äôt decide if I want to switch all my classes to online (drop classes&amp; switch the sections) or just suck it through, hope that‚Äôs I get my dorm changed on the 28th, and hopefully get a dorm that isn‚Äôt Sanford. I live in an hour and a half away from UNCC, so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to commute.

I‚Äôve always valued my personal space in a dorm. And in all honesty, having a roommate isn‚Äôt an issue for me. It‚Äôs the fact that there are not sufficient outlets in my dorm, there‚Äôs only outlets on my roommates side, and I‚Äôve never dealt with a communal bathroom, and I don‚Äôt wanna deal with that my first semester here. [mental health reasons that I can‚Äôt really elaborate on in here, related to trauma]

I‚Äôm nervous, and I don‚Äôt want my academics to suffer as a result of my living situation. I plan on living in a student apartment for fall. But not for this spring, and maybe I could somehow decide on a student apartment within the next few days, but I‚Äôm so unsure of this because I‚Äôm not sure if I would get a refund from living off campus, I just know I would have to pay like $700 because of late cancellation.

At this point I hope so bad we go all online ‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think this time UNCC is gonna do anything different compared to last year (my best friend goes to UNCC so I know the protocols that were put in place) I‚Äôm sure all classes will continue to be in person.

Can someone please give me their input? I sadly have no one to discuss this with right now and I need to act fast so I can see if my classes can switch sections to an all online format.

I don‚Äôt need your inconsiderate comments of ‚Äúmaybe on campus life isn‚Äôt for you‚Äù, because I lived on campus at my other uni and loved it. I just value my space, A LOT. This is just overwhelming me for me as a transfer student. It makes me feel icky knowing that it‚Äôs very possible that I won‚Äôt be able to have my room changed on the 28th because for some reason there‚Äôs so many people trying to move in for spring.

strugglingstudent00,"Im tired of paying full price on tuition and for all the amenities at UNCC to only keep getting screwed. Everyone who has taken online classes at this point knows you are only getting about 50% of the value of what you would get if the class was in person since you cant make connections with professors, students, professors get lazy and classes overall are less engaging. I've had teachers come in the first day of class and just say ""this class is now online, if you dont want to do an online class switch classes"" like it is an option for everyone to just switch to a different teacher and time last minute. Teachers have been by in-large been much harder to contact since I never have the opportunity to see some of them in person and they don't respond to emails in a reasonable amount of time. Teachers have even lowered the standards for what is acceptable and what it takes to pass the class drastically since I got here in 2019. I get that UNCC made their budget before we really knew what would happen with covid but if the school is cutting it this close in funds they need to really reevaluate their budget for the future semesters. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In regards to UREC and campus clubs:** 

Limiting capacity and operating hours at UNCC is just going to hurt the students who want to use the gym. By changing the operating hours from 10 am-6 pm you are only forcing more students to show up at a given time and increasing the likelihood you hit max capacity on the floor or the gym as a whole. This was a huge annoyance in 2020 and 2021 when the capacity rules were enforced because it just meant you were wasting sometimes 30+ minutes just to do what you came to the gym to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is no secret that the Universities get away with charging more than the value of their classes by stating ""students get a well rounded social and academic atmosphere that promotes development in multiple facets of life."" Well now that we are losing club and gyms and all the other ""non-essential"" aspects of our college experience(albeit temporarily) where is our compensation?

If you're at all interested or have any questions, take a look at the info flyer I made, and send me an email at [mkatz5@uncc.edu](mailto:mkatz5@uncc.edu).

Thanks so much for your time, and happy new year. ‚ù§Ô∏è

When it came to transferring my necessary credits, I got a new academic adviser who was extremely unprofessional.

Also, the professor at the institute where I was taking that credit put the incorrect grade on my transcript, and it took days for it to refresh.

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I wanted to come on here and provide an in depth update with everything I know regarding the Omicron variant and how it will be affecting our spring start. As recently as two days ago, I stated that to the best of my knowledge, no serious conversations surrounding us moving online due to Omicron had occurred. That was true then, however as we have seen, situations with COVID change often and they change rapidly. My apologies as this will be a lengthy post, however the seriousness of the situation makes it feel appropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

After consultation with public health officials and system office personnel, the decision has been made to begin our spring semester in an online capacity for the first two weeks. I cannot emphasize it enough, this is a decision that was not made lightly. Multiple circumstances led to this decision. The positivity rate in Mecklenburg County is currently at 15.4%, and is expected to continue to climb in the upcoming weeks. Not commented on in the Niner Notice are the significant logistical concerns that in my opinion represent the heart of the issue at hand. While early indications show that Omicron is less dangerous than Delta, we also know it spreads much more rapidly, resulting in a positive COVID test that necessitates a period of quarantine. For students that live on campus, this would mean the University is obligated to provide essential support services such as isolation housing, dining, sanitization of rooms and more. The University was already facing a significant labor shortage prior to the rise of omicron, and with the high positivity rate in the county, this only further complicates the situation if essential personnel are sidelined with COVID. This has the potential to create a nightmare scenario in which we have an overwhelming number of students who are required to quarantine without the necessary staff on hand to provide essential services. After examining all factors and current capabilities, the decision was made that it is in the best interest of the student body for us to begin online and reduce the chances of experiencing the scenario described above. With the projected peak currently slated for the end of January, the hope is that these two weeks will provide us enough breathing room to preserve the remainder of our semester.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot emphasize it enough, it is my belief this decision ultimately boils down to current government regulations, labor issues faced by the school, and current capabilities to address a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The University is obligated to abide by current government regulations which require an individual to quarantine for a certain number of days, regardless of whether they have omicron, delta, the original strand of the COVID-19 virus, or any other. They are required to quarantine regardless of the severity (or lack thereof) of an individual's symptoms. The University, as a public institution, **must** abide by these regulations. With the current government measures in place, the labor issues mentioned above, and the ability for Omicron to rapidly spread, a mass outbreak has the potential to overwhelm University resources. That is what this decision boils ultimately down to, more than anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

You likely have a number of questions about this decision and how it will affect the upcoming semester. While the Niner Notice contains the answer to most questions, I am still engaged in conversations with administrators in regards to more specific or individual questions about dining, housing, student life, academics, athletics, and more. As the dust settles, I'll be making a follow up post to address major questions. In the meantime, should you have any pressing questions, please feel free to comment them below, and I will do my best to either answer your question or track down the information you need.

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize this announcement will likely invoke strong feelings of frustration, disappointment, anger, and more. From the bottom of my heart, I sympathize deeply with all of those feelings and share in many of them. Throughout this process, I want to personally assure you that I have expressed your concerns to the school, and Student Government is working closely with University administration to get through this difficult time as quickly as possible to provide you with the safe, normal semester that we all want. As this situation continues to evolve, as conversations are had and decisions continue to be made, I will do everything I possibly can to advocate on your behalf and keep you updated with how the process evolves.  As always, thank you for the continued privilege to serve you as your Student Body President.",UNCCharlotte,COVID-19 Omicron SGA Update,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/rt14d7/covid19_omicron_sga_update/,rt14d7,71,41,"12/31/2021, 14:18:38"

GonnaSnipeUM8,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my process for finding textbooks as cheap as possible. Some of you may already know this stuff, but posting extra info can never hurt.

First thing's first, if you have a textbook that's required and only available custom from UNCC, you usually just have to get it straight from them. You rarely may be able to find it in some other places, but I normally just get them from the school. 

If it's not one only written by the school, the first thing I do is check out the book titles using a custom-written Google search engine. You can just put in the name of the textbook, and it'll try to find matching PDF files for those books. With some things, it might be better to have a physical book, but for smaller classes where you don't care too much to use a physical book, a PDF can be found pretty easily through this search engine as long as it exists. I've gotten a few books for less important classes like LBSTs through here.

[Custom Google search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=011394183039475424659:5bfyqg89ers)

My next step is using [isbnsearch.org](https://isbnsearch.org/) which is quite honestly the only other website you need. It brings up a lot of current stores selling or renting the book by ISBN and I save hundreds of dollars each semester going through here, usually renting whatever is cheapest unless a purchasable book is even cheaper. A $175 book was about $10 rented, which was the greatest change I saw. 

If you want to possibly find even cheaper versions, searching to see if that book has a comparable international version can be helpful too. I got one of my engineering textbooks in the international form, and after double-checking that the book pages and content were the same, it saved me about 70 bucks over the US version.

I've just heard from some people that they don't know where else to go besides something like Chegg or UNCC's store (which is almost always the worst) so I figured I'd share the stuff I've found from my research.

Last semester I would have burned about $300 going through UNCC's store, and doing this I only spent about $120. This semester would have been $372, and I only paid $197. 

Enjoy saving money on overpriced textbooks, and good luck next semester :)

TL;DR:

Use this [custom google search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=011394183039475424659:5bfyqg89ers) to see if PDFs of the books exist

If not, use [isbnsearch.org](https://isbnsearch.org/) to compare prices of many places listing the books

charluteer,"I transferred from CPCC in Spring 2020. I was set to graduate in the spring (2022) but I am 2 credits short after registering and I didn't get approved for the waiver to take additional courses over 18.

The classes I have left, other than 1 course in my major, are general eds. I basically have 12 credits of general education courses that would be satisfied if I had an associates. I compared my transcripts from CP and UNCC with the requirements for the associates and read over basically everything. I know that I definitely have the credits for the associates. 

The problem is, they don't evaluate reverse transfer requirements until February/March for the spring time. I also remember reading that they stop automatically evaluating after 90 credit hours earned but you can request to have it reviewed. **Does anyone have insight on how this works?** I actually do not care about graduating in the spring, I more so care about not having to take spanish/math because those are two courses that would be satisfied with my associates.

BarracudaFit6522,"This is the second time this happened because my GPA was right below 2.0. the first time this happened was last year. It was my first year at University and I failed and withdrew many classes because of covid 19 related issues, including job loss, taking care of sick family, and loss of motivation. I'm pretty sure my GPA was around 1.2 or 1.3 if I remember right. Well over the summer I appealed it, stating the issues that caused me academic failure, and it was approved.

Fast forward to now, I passed all my classes. 1 A and 3 C's. Not the best performance but still passing. Now my GPA is a 1.83, and I was put on financial aid suspension again. I just finished appealing it, stating the same reasons. That even though I did way better this semester, it wasn't enough to pull me out the hole I was put last year and that I will keep working towards this goal and better grades.

What are my chances of it being approved twice in a row? I feel like I have a better shot of approval now considering I passed all my classes, but I'm still worried.

Matt2580,"I've been trying to figure out what's going on since this morning and cant wrap my head around it. I woke up to find out I had been withdrawn from my classes and listed in banner as Inactive-Suspended. my advisor told me over a phone call it was due to unsatisfactory academic progress. I know my grades aren't great(GPA as of this last semester is a 1.73) because things went very poorly for me my first two semesters(Fall 2020 &amp; Spring 2021) at UNCC.

Relevant back story: To make a long story short, thanks to Covid I was trying to do online classes with undiagnosed ADHD and it just wasn't working. I got so frustrated I gave up during spring 2021 after the withdraw period and just let my classes go(I think I passed one of them but that's it) I was notified that if I wanted to continue to to receive financial aid I needed to fill out a SAP(Satisfactory Academic Progress) form which I did, and it stated that I needed to achieve a 2.5 GPA or better and make a passing or better grade in 75% of the courses I enrolled in, and that I had 3 semesters to do it(the max number of SAP appeals one can apply for is 3 so I figured 3 semesters), so I was led to believe that  I had 3 semesters to get my act together. Fall 21 semester I was still struggling with untreated ADHD until October 8th at which point I finally got medication that helped, but by that point of my 3 classes, calc 1 was in the low 40% range and my other 2 classes were low 70s. I spent the last 2 months of the semester fighting to get my calc 1 grade back to an acceptable level(I finished in the low 70% range!) and my other two classes finished with a D and a C. those grades aren't great I know, but they met the requirements of the SAP appeal so I thought I was good to go for next semester which was when I was going to improve my GPA.  


Now I'm being told I'm outright suspended from the university and have to appeal that suspension. According to my advisor I was expected to raise my GPA to a 2.3(from a 1.68) last semester and if I don't get that appeal I'm barred from attending the university for 2 years, I cant afford to be out of college that long. I guess my question is, why wasn't I told about this before the fall semester even began? or when I spoke with my advisor in November? why is this being dropped on me with zero fucking warning? Why does the SAP appeal imply I have 3 semesters to raise my GPA but apparently I don't?",UNCCharlotte,Suspended from the university without warning?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/rm9i4v/suspended_from_the_university_without_warning/,rm9i4v,3,6,"12/22/2021, 12:00:23"

I‚Äôm always at home, alone and bored at times waiting for some attention because all of the friends I had have stopped talking to me since the beginning of the pandemic separated us. The worst part is that she lives in the neighborhood directly across from mine!! And the things I want to do with her doesn‚Äôt take all day. I just want to spend maybe an hour or two with her. But she can‚Äôt give me the light of day to hang out with her ONCE. I now have a job, and I only have so many days I can hang out with her. I even made sure to let her know IN A WEEK‚ÄôS ADVANCE that we need to do something together, but she IS ALWAYS BUSY THE DAYS I PICK!! For Christmas, we both bought roller skates to hang out in when together, but even the day AFTER Christmas, she‚Äôs not available to roller skate with me because she‚Äôs having a Christmas party with her family. Um, ALL DAY?! I told her that I was working every day after the day after Christmas, but she didn‚Äôt TRY to budge. I‚Äôm trying to stay friends with her the best I can because we have so much in common and there‚Äôs no drama going on in our friendship. But as an only child who‚Äôs been basically neglected by people/family her entire life, I believe I deserve more! I feel all of these feelings, and I always regret feeling this way, but I can‚Äôt help it. Should I even regret it at all? Am I in the wrong? Am I too clingy at times?

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,

I hope this finds you well. For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is the Chair of the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y‚Äôall on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.

**Campus Lighting-** I had a meeting this week with John Bogdan, Associate Vice Chancellor for Safety and Security at Charlotte (AVC), to discuss concerns I have heard regarding lighting around campus. Before the meeting, I went out at night to gain my own perspective of where I believe the most lighting issues are present. The conclusion I came to was the same as the concerns I had been hearing: campus lighting is overall great, but there are a few lights that do not work, and lighting around Greek Village and the Greenway are not great. When meeting with AVC Bogdan, he informed me that he had been looking into solutions for the Greenway lighting for multiple years, but it is a difficult task considering the Greenway is owned by the City of Charlotte and it would be very expensive to complete. That does not mean the task is impossible though and AVC Bogdan is still looking into increasing the lighting in that area. Greek Village, on the other hand, is owned by the University and would not be quite as costly. AVC Bogdan noted that he had not been in that area in quite some time, but now that he is aware of the issue, he will head over there and determine where new lights need to be placed to increase lighting.

**Car Break Ins-** During my meeting with John Bogdan, I discussed the University‚Äôs plan for combating these recent car break ins. If you didn‚Äôt know- earlier this week 24 cars were broken into around campus. A total of three items were reported missing, so most of the damage came from broken windows, slashed tires, and other car damages. AVC Bogdan informed me that increasing security to prevent these types of situations has been an ongoing investigation for the past couple of months. Thankfully, the University was just approved by the North Carolina Board of Governors for around one and a half million dollars to increase the number of cameras and security present around campus and specifically in parking lots/decks. While this increased security is being put into place, AVC Bogdan let me know that there is an increased police and direct patrol presence to reduce the possibility of another situation like the one that happened earlier this week. Though security has been and is being improved, it is always a good reminder to lock your car doors and not to leave valuables in your cars.

**COVID-19 and Next Semester-** As you might have heard by now, we had a student test positive for the [Omicron strand of COVID-19](https://emergency.charlotte.edu/communications/ninernotice/latest-ninernotices). This is certainly not expected, but Dick has connected with AVC Bogdan and they discussed how early studies show that Omicron is more transmissible but we don‚Äôt have reason to believe at this time that it is significantly more dangerous. The University is committed to monitoring ongoing changes as they have been throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and will adjust accordingly. As of right now, barring any sort of drastic shift, the University is still committed to a relatively normal spring semester. I spoke to Dick and he anticipates that we will still be in person and we will continue to wear masks indoors as we have been. Just a reminder, the best way we can ensure the preservation of a regular semester is to get the COVID-19 vaccine, any applicable booster shots, and to continue to observe the mask policy. Doing so gives us the best chance to keep Niner Nation safe.

I hope you all had an amazing semester. As this was my first semester in SGA here at Charlotte, I wanted to thank you all again for the amazing opportunity to represent y‚Äôall. I am very excited to keep providing SGA updates for many semesters to come. Also, if you noticed in the opening paragraph, I was just recently elected to the Chair of the Publicity and Outreach Committee. I am honored to serve in this position and I will do my best to ensure all students' voices are heard and all students are aware of the work we do in SGA. I wish all of you luck on your finals, Happy Holidays, and have a great rest of your year!

EveninqSkies,"I feel so stupid.

I've been on anti-depressants for a little over six years now. About a month, maybe a month and a half ago, I started to forget my morning pill occasionally. A few weeks after that, I forgot my medication for a week - I knew because I went to my parents house for Thanksgiving and went I was packing to come back, I realized I had left my morning medications in my bag the whole fucking time.

Well, if you know anything about antidepressants, it's that it takes a bit for the effects to hit and you will TANK mentally if you're not careful. I'd been struggling to motivate myself as it was the past month - for all I know, the medication problems have been going on far longer than I thought - but now I feel like I'm going to throw up because the symptoms of ""withdrawal"" are hitting me hard and I'm so anxious and stressed - my medication is also sometimes used for anxiety, so that ironically made things worse. 

I'm backed up on assignments and have to study for four exams. I'm so stressed out because I'm probably going to get Bs and Cs in all of my classes and disappoint my parents, my family, my friends, and my professors.

And do you know how fucking stupid I'm going to sound when I say my lack of motivation and general depression was because I forgot my fucking anti-depressants for a couple of weeks that I've been taking for six years?! Like any professor will believe that. And if they did, that's no excuse for just. Blanking out for the past couple of weeks.

Literally I cannot think of anything productive I've done. Class, dorm. Class, dining hall. Class, dorm. Rinse and repeat. I realized for the past couple of weeks I've been holing myself in on the weekends too.

I have class in 30 fucking minutes and I'm crying so much but I have to go because it's a review session for a class I apparently have a borderline C in. So, uh, yeah. I'm a dumbass.

To be blunt and to summarize a very long story short I had a falling out with my previous major, not because of poor performance but because I realized I'm not interested in the subject anymore. I am planning on switching into finance however I am about worried about having to take Calc (1120). I already took Stat so that is out of the way, but I took Algebra over a year ago at this point and don't remember anything from it. I did get an A in this class, but it should be noted the professor was a very chill grader who even dropped our lowest exam grade, which for me was like a 69 from what I remember. What I am asking is how important is the Algebra Pre Req for Calc, because I know I didn't use it at all in Stats. There is a Pre Calc course although 1103 looks like it's more geared for stem students going into 1241. Would I be ok going Stright into 1120?

My inspection is that UNCC requires that because the upper management has been eyeing a new yacht and for the same reason they compelled the student to come back to school without Covid being eradicated.

Hey friends,

Had this idea where we create a website, where we host our resume, bio, links to our github, even host our projects online. As a senior, I realized that I didn't have much to show other than school projects. I don't really have time to work a traditional internship.

I created and LLC under the name LangTree Tech. Originally the idea was to create a business that provided IT/software development to local businesses. I got the name copyrighted and secured the domain [langtreetech.com](https://langtreetech.com) (currently trying to get node js to work :/)

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,

I hope this finds you well. For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is the Vice Chair or the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y‚Äôall on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.

**HEERF III Update-** If you are unaware, HEERF III is essentially a stimulus check for Charlotte students who meet the qualifications. During the HEERF III wave earlier this year, the university decided to save some money in reserve. This was with the expectation that it would have longer lasting effects throughout the rest of the year. When the Delta variant caused a massive spike in COVID cases across the states and country, it was clear that the decision to keep funds for another wave of HEERF III was a good idea. The second wave of HEERF III is now going out to students who qualify. Many people who qualify for aid still have not received an email about their funds. We believe that the emails are sent out in waves. Dick is going to touch base with Bruce Blackmon, the Director of Financial Aid, on Monday to confirm. It is also possible that the holidays have factored into this. If you think you qualify for HEERF III and you are yet to receive an email, wait about a week to see if you are in one of the later waves of emails. If you still haven‚Äôt received an email by the end of next week and you believe you may qualify, I suggest that you reach out to the financial aid office or fill out an emergency aid application. Also, to reiterate what Dick stated last update, I am aware that the holiday season and Black Friday are approaching quickly, but I encourage anyone who receives aid and has an outstanding balance with the university to strongly consider prioritizing paying off that tab first.

**Swipe Out Hunger-** Swipe Out Hunger is a drive by Charlotte where you can take left over meal swipes you have at the end of the semester and you can donate them to students who have financial need or food insecurity instead of the meal swipes just vanishing. Currently, students must manually go through the Niner Diners mobile app to donate their extra swipes. Many questions have arisen, and I believe rightfully so, about why the university does not automatically donate leftover meal swipes. We reached out to Leadership and Community Engagement at Charlotte to discuss this issue and they are looking into this situation. Because of Thanksgiving break it is difficult to reach out to people, but the situation is currently being looked into.

**Increased Wages for Returning Dining Service Employees-** One of the potential causes of the staffing and hiring problems was wage issues for workers. The reason for poor hours and food quality in dining areas also can be traced back to staffing and hiring issues. SGA has been working hard since the beginning of the semester in order to increase student wages. I give props to Christian Rios, the Chair of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, who worked with the Associate Vice Chancellor for Business Services and the Interim Director of Auxiliary Services and Food Services Program Manager to discuss a potential wage increase for food service workers on campus. The university administration has formally approved a $0.50 wage increase every August for every student who returns after a year of previous work, increasing their base pay successfully every academic year they return to work for dining services. We hope this wage increase will aid the staffing and hiring issues that we currently face.¬†

As it is Thanksgiving, I would like for you to all know that I am extremely thankful I am for each of you for giving me the opportunity to serve in this position. I would also like to thank all SGA members for the work we all do to represent the student body. If you have any questions/concerns or you just want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out anytime via email at jmorr151@uncc.edu. I can also meet up in person for more prominent issues if necessary, I have a flexible schedule. I hope you all are enjoying your break and have a Happy Thanksgiving!

RevolutionFun4902,"I was an A student in high school and I cared about pretty much nothing except getting into and applying to and looking good for college during that time (didn‚Äôt have a lot of fun). 

I can feel myself very quickly slipping into a similar cycle now except with undergrad and grad school. School has always been what I‚Äôm ‚Äúgood at‚Äù, (at least in the sense that it was always my excuse that I may not be particularly outgoing or athletic but I *am* a good student). Recently the idea of busting my ass for all of undergrad, getting a killer GRE score, and then getting into the grad program of my choice is very unappealing to me but I know it‚Äôs what I should do (what else can you do with a 4 year degree in biology, lol). 

Basically, it‚Äôs really difficult for me to get  myself to do anything, and my grades have been worse than they ever have been in my life (gpa will drop .2 this semester) I don‚Äôt do anything but go to school, work, drive home, do homework, sleep, and repeat. I would like to go into a master‚Äôs program after undergrad but recently, my experience with one of my chem classes had left me feeling worthless and not cut out for my field. I don‚Äôt know if this is just me but I find the culture of my major really toxic and I‚Äôm constantly convinced that I will not achieve anything I want or be good enough for anything. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not trying (I‚Äôll have a 3.5 after this shit show of a semester,) but I‚Äôm not happy, but I feel like most college students aren‚Äôt happy.

GonnaSnipeUM8,"[Swipe out hunger email](https://i.imgur.com/lCu9j69.png)

I got this email about donating meal swipes to other students to help them with food security, which is prefaced with:

**""Did you know that one in three college students experience food insecurity?""**

It doesn't surprise me one bit. College students are being squeezed for every last drop of their money through ever-increasing tuition and fees, including paying for meal plans. 

Why does this need to be a thing? Why is the university we attend asking the STUDENTS who already pay so much, to give to others in need? This should be a responsibility of the UNIVERSITY.

UNCC earned a total of 794.2 million dollars in the fiscal year of 2021 ([source from audit here](https://finance.charlotte.edu/resources/informational-documents/financial-statement-audit-reports-year-end-2017-2021)). 27% of this was student tuition and fees, which equates to about 214.4 million dollars. 

Operating costs were 644.1 million dollars, which leaves us at a profit of 150 million dollars. 

The university is profiting over 100 million dollars a fiscal year, and can't spare enough to remove the problem of food insecurity? They are instead asking the students who are desperately in need of any financial assistance possible for their already paid for swipes. In the 214.4 million dollars that specifically students paid, there isn't any money able to be allocated to those who are in so much financial turmoil that they can't even buy food?

If any of my perceptions are off here, please explain them to me, as it's possible there are more complexities than I've seen. However from what I can tell, this looks like a mass deflection of issues onto the students to make them feel like it's their problem, instead of the massive university who is charging $10/meal to everyone who uses their dining hall.

As well, I realize that the food pantry exists and that is a wonderful cause that benefits a lot of students, however even that is bittersweet to think about. Many students wouldn't need that food pantry if they could actually afford the meal swipes with a financial aid discount or some other program enabled by any of this massive profit.

I'm just so tired of being overcharged in every aspect of going to university, and seeing this email saddened me knowing all of the help the university can provide with such a small portion of their profits, yet instead they have to preserve every penny to the point they're willing to starve those one in three students unless other paying students will fork over their swipes.",UNCCharlotte,Why does this need to exist?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/qyyxos/why_does_this_need_to_exist/,qyyxos,105,20,"11/21/2021, 11:48:20"

Hi Y'all!

""Humbug!"" you say? Alright, but where do traditions and phrases of the holidays come from? 

Apologies again for cancelling Tora, Tora, Tora! But TONIGHT we're going to visit the 19th century and follow Charles Dickens' story of how he wrote A Christmas Carol and ended up creating a bunch of the holiday depictions we know today.¬†

So buckle up and let's head to London, and see how one writer short on a deadline can end up learning some lessons about life and creating a true meaning of Christmas alongside his beloved characters like Scrooge¬†and Tiny Tim.¬†

See you later!

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/UNCC) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as filter courses by department and level and compare these courses. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking and know what to expect.

Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.

Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.

Enjoy!!",UNCCharlotte,I made ratemyprofessors but for classes: Rate My Courses,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/qvpw6n/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes_rate_my/,qvpw6n,1,0,"11/16/2021, 22:30:16"

loveiscute,"What have you done to try to communicate with group members that don't do much?  I feel like I'm pulling teeth to get people to talk in the gc and do actual work. Our *term* project is due in 2 weeks and it seems like only 1 other group member out of the 6 of us actually cares about getting this done. I am debating on talking to the prof but I'm afraid he is going to ask me to reach out to them individually and take on more of a role than I already have (initiating conversation, planning, delegating, etc.) which I barely have time for anyway. I'm not sure what to do, advice is welcome.

At this time, Counseling and Psychological Services is reaching out to our
mental health advocates asking for your input as we explore additional tools
and resources for our campus community.  


One of the resources we are exploring is an online self-paced module for
students.  This is an interactive role-play simulation for students that builds
awareness, knowledge, and skills about mental health and suicide prevention,
and prepares users to lead real-life conversations with fellow students in
distress and connect them with support.


We are looking for students to complete the self-paced demo and complete a
brief feedback form.  The module and form should take about 30 minutes to
complete.

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. It is truly a pleasure being able to hop back on here after a hiatus. Between my obligations as Student Body President, a member of the Board of Trustees, and a senior getting beaten alive by two honors thesis (thesi? Thesisis? Nobody has been able to correctly tell me the plural form yet....) life has been incredibly busy. I'm thankful that Joe was able to come on here and pick up some of the slack for me, but I really wanted to make it a priority this week to come on here and share some updates with y'all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Veteran's Day-** A question came up on this sub that I thought was a rather good one. u/pkim173 asked the other day [""Why do we have class on Veteran's Day?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/qmzrmx/why_do_we_have_class_on_veterans_day/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) It's funny, but as a veteran myself I had never really given the question much thought. Considering our founding as an institution designed to meet the needs of returning World War II veterans, it did seem odd that we don't have the day off. It should be noted that outside of the service academies (which are federal institutions), I couldn't find a single other university that observes the day. Having said that, I couldn't see any reason why not to push for this. Myself and a number of senators engaged in conversations with faculty and administrators, and following those conversations, it appears that moving forward, Veteran's Day will be observed as a non-instructional day by the university. Some points to note, we cannot simply make a day appear out of nowhere. The university is mandated to have a certain amount of days of instruction for accreditation purposes. As such, the proposal is to sacrifice one day of winter break in exchange for Veteran's Day off. While I'd love to keep my full break, in the conversations I had it seemed the general consensus was that being able to observe Veteran's Day was ideal, and that even for students without direct ties to the holiday that as we hit the height of the semester, another non-instructional would be beneficial. As for the timeline surrounding this, academic calendars typically get approved years in advance. Theres still some logistical work being done to determine when the earliest this can be implemented is, as well as some clarification needed on how to balance the calendar in a way that gives equal consideration to MWF classes and T/Th classes. But the good news is that at the end of the day, it looks as though this is going to be a strong reality.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hammocks-** Staying on the topic of good ideas that have been thrown out on this sub, u/datgirl1708 asked [""what's going on with the broken hammocks?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/qqb1ka/broken_hammocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I really love this post because it's an example as to why I believe it's so important for members of Student Government to be engaged with other students. I have never once used the hammocks in my life, and to be quite frank, the middle of November isn't when I was going to start. As such, I wasn't even aware that they were in need of repair. I saw the post, went out to look at the hammocks, and sure enough, yeah they're in desperate need of repair. I spoke with Rich Steele, the Interim Associate Vice Chancellor for Facilities Management (that's one heck of a title) and brought the issue to his attention. He's already responded back that he's going to be making this a priority for his department. I wanted to bring this up, because I think it really highlights the voice that students have. My view on my position and Student Government as a whole is that we exist to work for students. There are various issues throughout this university, and unfortunately as simply one person and not an omniscient being, it is impossible for me to know all the issues that exist. What is possible is for me to advocate on your behalf when you make me, or Student Government, aware of issues. I can't always guarantee the outcome, but whoever represents you should care enough to be your biggest fighter.

&amp;#x200B;

**HEERF III-** Ending on a bit of a pleasant surprise, I have updates regarding HEERF III. As you may recall, when we first allocated the HEERF III funds, we kept some in reserve, with the intention of doing a second wave. The purpose behind this was to provide a safety net in case the pandemic had lingering effects. Considering this decision was made before the Delta spike, it was clearly a wise move in hindsight. I spoke with Bruce Blackmon, the Director of Financial Aid, and have some good news regarding the second wave. The second wave is projected to start going out the week of Thanksgiving. Fully Pell eligible students can be expected to receive $1,000, and students with an EFC of $10,000 and less can expect between $500-750. Additionally, there will be approximately $200k kept in emergency reserves for individuals to apply for on a case by case basis via application. While Black Friday is quickly approaching, I would be remiss if I didn't encourage anyone who receives aid and has an outstanding balance with the university to strongly consider prioritizing paying off that tab first. I hope that this unexpected good news can provide some relief from stress as we enter into the holiday season.

&amp;#x200B;

It's always a pleasure being able to hop on here and provide updates. I've often described this sub as my ""happy place"" and it truly has been one of my favorite aspects of my job. Eventually however I will be graduating (assuming these two thesis or thesi or thesisis don't kill me first) and part of my responsibility is ensuring that initiatives like this continue beyond my time here. It truly is important to me that Student Government remains engaged with the Student Body on platforms like this. As such, you'll likely see more of Joe and others around. That's not to say I won't be here, I always am, typically lurking in the comment section identifying issues that need to be addressed and throwing in my two cents when appropriate, and I'll still be making posts. But at some point comes the time to hand off the baton, and unfortunately that time is coming near for me.

fishfearme122,"Hello everyone! My name is Christian Rios and I'm currently the DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) chair in senate for Student Government Association.

Just a couple of updates to see reddit on the loop on what my committee has been working on this semester. I've brought it up on my last post but this is **ONLY** updates on what my committee has been working on, and doesn't reflect the Student Government Association as a whole or the branch of Senate. Anyway here's the juicy stuff

One of the most important updates is that after meeting with some school administrations and faculty, there is going to be an increase in wages for student workers in dining services. One of my biggest goals this year was to increase wages for student workers as students aren't simply making enough on campus for the amount of work they do. I also believe that the low wages may discourage students from working, adding to the labor shortage and the already long lines on campus. To this end I've met with Jody Thompson who's the Interim Director of Auxiliary Services and Rich Steele who's the Associate Vice Chancellor for Business Services. After meeting with them, and discussing the ideas a little further we got some great news: there is going to be a .50 cent wage increase every August for students who return to work. This increases their pay, and incentives students to return every semester. I know it seems like a small amount, but considering there was no wage increase before, it's a victory nonetheless.

Another thing that committee has been working on has been a bookstore buy back program. Basically the idea was that the bookstore buys textbooks that are gently used from students for a proportion of the original price. This was done in order to reduce waste, give some money back to students, and have more textbooks on hands to reduce shortages. The great news is that the University already offers a program like this! The bad news is that there hasn't been enough to put word about that. I'm working with Jody Thompson in order to increase awareness this but if you're curious to see how the buy back program works here's a link. [https://securex.bncollege.com/shop/unc-charlotte-cc/page/sell-back-textbooks](https://securex.bncollege.com/shop/unc-charlotte-cc/page/sell-back-textbooks). Don't worry about forgetting, like I said the University is working to advertise it heavier this year.

Lastly DEI is working on things for black history month so please be on the lookout for some announcements that we're super excited to share with you.

I hope everyone has a good rest of the week! If you concerns, comments, suggestions or questions about what we do or anyway we can help you please feel free to comment, message me or reach out to my email at [crios8@uncc.edu](mailto:crios8@uncc.edu).

Have you seen the musical based on the 1899 Newsboys Strike? Or are you curious about what actually happened or what Disney does when they turn it into a musical?

I‚Äôd love to be able to room with my best friend who is currently enrolled at UNCC but the problem is; I‚Äôm a cisgendered woman and they are trans fem [MTF]. They have not gone through sex reassignment surgery. [they would love to get it, but it‚Äôs expensive and they‚Äôve just begun HRT anyways]

I‚Äôm aware Gender affirming housing exists and they live in one already, but it‚Äôs a bit icky how the bathrooms are shared among the halls in the building that they currently live in [Holshouser]. I was wondering, that if we were to provide the necessary paperwork to UNCC to state that it‚Äôs important that we can live together, if it would be possible. My best friend has all the paper work of proof of being transgender and identifying as a trans fem person, as well as in the process of getting paper work for mental health disability accommodations. I‚Äôm also getting those disability accommodations.

Would there be a loop hole in us being able to live together in a suite or so? My best friend does not identify as a man or masculine&amp; has the literal paper work to prove their trans identity, they‚Äôre literally on HRT! so I don‚Äôt understand just why I just can‚Äôt live with my best friend. I know off campus housing is a possibility, and we will get off campus housing regardless if we can‚Äôt live in a suite together.

Hi Everyone!

I hope you are all having a good day out there and just want to send some encouragement your way that we're halfway through the semester and we got this Niners! Tonight the club is watching The Da Vinci Code, which we're calling ""haunted"" because the two club cancellations were on the night we were going to watch it and the rescheduled day :) If you haven't seen the movie or have and just want to re-watch the classic, we'll be meeting in Denny 102 at 6:30pm - but we don't judge if you can't make it until 7 or whenever your schedule permits. Afterwards we'll be looking over the stories behind the Holy Grail and catching some of the ways the movie used these base stories for inspiration.

Hey guys, I‚Äôm a sophomore here at Charlotte and I‚Äôve been struggling recently with my mental health (which seems to be normal at this time). I‚Äôve been in recovery from an eating disorder for about two years now, my last treatment wasn‚Äôt super intense as I went to treatment pretty early on. I‚Äôve been doing pretty well over these last two years and continued to make progress, but at the beginning of the year I noticed some old and unhealthy habits making reappearances. I did my best to get rid of them/ignore them. Well, here we are a few months later and I have completely relapsed. It‚Äôs a lot worse this time around and I‚Äôm honestly becoming more and more concerned. No one knows about this, I‚Äôve really been kind of dealing with it on my own, and I think it‚Äôs come to a point where I can‚Äôt do it alone anymore. I‚Äôve been looking into treatment options, trying to mentally prepare myself for whatever my therapist may suggest if I talk to her about this, but if I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôm really concerned about school. If I go an intensive outpatient route I would still be able to do my schoolwork, but I would need some accommodations when it comes to class meetings. But if my therapist recommends a residential route, I obviously won‚Äôt be able to continue with school.

KnohaParker,"Concord Mills Mall has these like gacha machines with like keychains and stuff, and it's a little pricey for what it is but that's besides the point. One of the gachas is Kingdom Hearts figurines, and my BF is a bit of a mega fan when it comes to KH, so I've slowly been acquiring a few of these gachas for him. 

He's in comp sci so he sometimes uses these gachas as like the rubber duck (coding debugging method) and was going to bring one with him to Atkins Library but then decided against it, and put it down, or he thought he did. Now he can't find it and it is no where in his room or at Atkins or Salsaritas (he stopped to get lunch before going off to study) so basically this is just a post asking if anyone has seen said gacha.

JeffJacksonNC,"‚ÄúHey Jeff, what‚Äôs happening with redistricting?‚Äù

It's not good, but here's the latest.

We‚Äôve got three levels of maps being drawn right now: State House (120 seats), state Senate (50 seats), and federal House (14 seats).

Here are a few basics to know:

1. Republicans are in the majority in the state legislature, so they have 100% control over how these maps are drawn. Specifically, majority party \*leadership\* is in control of the process. The Governor isn‚Äôt allowed to veto maps (a quirk of our state constitution), so the majority party can do whatever they want here, subject only to potential court involvement down the road.
2. The majority party has resisted any consideration of redistricting reform, which has been proposed countless times (the first bill I ever filed was an independent redistricting bill). Those bills are never even allowed to be heard in committee, let alone come to a vote, let alone pass. They can simply block it, and it appears that's what they'll do so long as they're in the majority. We don't have a referendum process in our state where you can collect a bunch of signatures to put something on the ballot, so the majority party can simply prevent redistricting reform from happening as long as they're in charge.
3. The majority party allowed a small number of public hearings on their proposed maps. They were purely for show so they could claim that they held some public hearings. The phrase ‚Äòdog and pony show‚Äô would be appropriate here.

So what do the new maps look like?

Well, there are a number of draft maps that have been filed. We don‚Äôt know which ones the majority party‚Äôs leadership will settle on yet, but we can tell from the drafts that the options range from heavily gerrymandered to extremely gerrymandered.

I expect they will pass the new maps within the next few weeks, which takes us into November.

That‚Äôs significant, because candidate filing is in December.

That means there‚Äôs an extra element of incumbent protection added to this process in the form of a highly compressed timeline for potential challengers.

How so? Well, let‚Äôs say you want to run for state Senate. Ok - what district do you live in? Who are you running against? You don‚Äôt know yet, and you won‚Äôt know until a few weeks before you have to file. You have virtually no time to prepare a run. And then the primary is in March. So if you‚Äôre challenging an incumbent in a primary it‚Äôs a 90-day sprint with maybe three weeks prep time. That‚Äôs the kind of crunch incumbents love to put challengers in.

Redistricting is - by far - the most significant thing our state legislature does. It sets the table for the policy agenda for the rest of the decade. And, as you can see, it is a top-to-bottom example of how the temptation of power corrupts elected officials.

Just as I expect we‚Äôll see in some states run by Democrats, by the way.

Absolutely no good news here. But that‚Äôs the situation.

MrWashy-Washy,"To everyone who has recently gained admission to the University, welcome!  While Reddit and this subreddit, in particular, can be discouraging and often times satirical towards those who are seeking admissions advice, know that you will be in good hands at Charlotte.  It is an extremely vibrant and diverse community, and you will have no trouble finding a group that suits you.  

A word of advice to prospective commuters, GET INVOLVED!  College will quickly start to feel like a chore if you only come here for lectures.  Set a goal to do at least one enjoyable thing every day you are at Charlotte, whether that be taking the light rail uptown for lunch with some friends, working out at UREC, or just taking a stroll around campus.  As homework begins to accumulate, you will find these activities incredibly therapeutic.

Finally, Charlotte suffers from the notion of it being a backup school.  While it is true that many students are here because they didn't get into the UNC's and the NC State's of the world, Charlotte affords a plethora of opportunities to those who are willing to work towards them.  The city of Charlotte is one of the nation's fastest-growing cities and companies are investing billions in the region.  No matter your major, chances are that Charlotte has internships and hands-on learning experiences waiting for you.  Being only a stone's throw from the urban core is a massive benefit that often goes overlooked by commuter students.  

College is ultimately what you make of it, as cliche as it sounds.  Charlotte is no exception, and this is especially true for commuter students.  If you were accepted, congrats!  If not, know that there are many paths to Charlotte. 

Good luck with the rest of your admissions processes, and make the right choice and join Niner Nation!

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,

I hope this finds you well. For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is the Vice Chair or the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y‚Äôall on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. I‚Äôm still here helping Dick out with these updates as he is still swamped with work. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.

**Conference Realignment-** First off, we have some very exciting news for Charlotte athletics. UNC Charlotte has just accepted an invitation to join the American Athletic Conference, also known as The American. Charlotte was invited for a variety of reasons including our history of athletic success as well as our up and coming football program. This is great for all our athletic programs because we will gain more media coverage, resulting in more attention to our programs, more revenue for our athletic department, and will increase our recruiting abilities. Though this is a very exciting milestone for the development of our athletics, the transition from Conference USA to The American will take a few years to complete.

**Pass/No Credit-** There have been some questions and discussions from students as to whether or not we will receive pass/no credit this semester. I‚Äôve checked in with him and Dick has spoken to the Faculty Council and Provost. Barring any catastrophic development, it seems unlikely that we will receive another round of pass/no credit this semester. However, this pandemic has highlighted the benefits of the flexibility offered by pass/no credit. Some of you may not be aware, but even before the pandemic, pass/no credit was already available. Each student receives two pass/no credit options for their time at Charlotte. It should be noted that any pass/no credits taken during the pandemic will not count against the standing two. Student Government is currently engaged in conversations with the Faculty Council and Provost to extend the pass/no credit deadline to mirror the withdrawal deadline. So why should you care about this? Historically, if you were in a class and your grade suffered to the point where you would consider withdrawing, your options were limited to withdrawing and losing any credit and having to possibly retake the course or rolling the dice and taking a shot at your GPA. This new option will allow you to stick through the course while simultaneously protecting your GPA. The earliest this would come into effect would be next semester but it's another example of how Student Government is looking out for y‚Äôall.

**HEERF III-** Many of you have asked about the possibility of another HEERF wave. If you are unaware, HEERF is essentially a stimulus check for Charlotte students who qualify. It should be noted that last spring UNC Charlotte received approximately $34 million in HEERF III funding to distribute to students. While we initially distributed approximately $24 million, we intentionally withheld $10 million for a later wave. The reason we did this was that while we anticipated the pandemic ending upon the introduction of the vaccine, there were concerns (justifiably in retrospect) that the financial impact of the pandemic may be long lasting and that later waves may be necessary to alleviate unforeseen burdens. Because of this, Charlotte is now in the enviable position of having funds for additional waves. Dick is still in the process of finding out exactly what the timeline and qualifications will be, but be aware that additional funds are coming.

In response to my first post on this subreddit a week ago, it has been great getting to know and interact with this community. I thank you all for creating a welcoming environment. As a member of Student Government, I will always fight to ensure every student has their voice and opinion heard. If you have any questions/concerns or you just want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out anytime via email at [jmorr151@uncc.edu](mailto:jmorr151@uncc.edu).

Hi Everyone!

In partnership with the Graduate History Association and Dr. Peter Thorsheim, the History Club will be meeting tonight (Wednesday 20th) at 5:15pm in Rowe 161! We'll be watching Goodbye Lenin and discussing the history behind the film later. 

*""The future lay in our hands. Uncertain yet promising.""* 

Goodbye Lenin holds a special place in my heart as it was the first film I watched at UNCC and started my habit of analyzing movies for their history as well as their cinematic merit. Tonight, I'll be handing it over to Dr. Thorsheim to analyze the movie (he's far more qualified than the fledgling grad student :) ) and we'll hear from him about the aftermath of the reunification of Germany post-Berlin Wall and what this has to do with this drama of a single family and their most times comedic takes on the changing world. 

The main character has sarcasm and wit (the best qualities for a protagonist) and he is forced to reconcile the past and the present when his pro-Communist mother wakes from her coma after the Wall falls and the family must hide the changing world from her so she does not go into shock. A hard enough task, but even more so for Alex - who never really liked Communism under the Soviet Union to begin with ...

It's one of those movies I think everyone should watch in their lifetime, and if you don't get the chance to join us tonight, then please by all means watch it in the database on Atkins Library (free and totally worth it). 

But if you are available, come on by. It doesn't matter if you know everything or nothing about the Cold War, I firmly believe everyone will come out of it with something new learned! If you have a 5:15pm class, no worries, we won't judge if you come in a little late. 

See you later and best of luck on your classes!

Mangoes0616,"Hello! I‚Äôm currently a biology major planning on graduating in December. However, there has been some concerns with one teacher of mine that I feel I should report about. 

Warning: pretty long rant‚Ä¶but for an important question 

Backstory: I go to their classes every single day I have them and never missed one. Always made sure I was on time or earlier to not disturb class time, took notes, and even answer some questions if I knew the answers to them. They even assign some questions in the beginning of class to answer and I get them done, even if I don‚Äôt remember the answers correctly. My grades are decent when it comes to those assignments and they said they don‚Äôt count as much as tests of course. But the first day of class, I had turned in that assignment and got my grade back next period on canvas. It was a 0 and I emailed about it to them and they responded with ‚Äòit‚Äôs the first day of class; I‚Äôll excuse it‚Äô which they did (It was on a note card so it was understandable that it may have slipped out of his pile but I brushed it off). 

Though it happened a second time but I know for sure I had turned it in especially since my friend was there to witness me placing it in the pile (it was a partner assignment). The teacher was even sitting down on the table and we even chatted a bit about what me and my friend discussed! Next day comes and it‚Äôs a zero for both of us when I know for sure it was in that pile. The following period was a test day so I couldn‚Äôt discuss it with them until next class. It was on a notecard again because that was the only piece of paper I had but I carry a notebook now. I told him that me and my friend could explain our answer word for word but they told us that we still wouldn‚Äôt get credit for it and thought we were lying about putting the paper on the desk when they were sitting right there. I‚Äôm not the smartest or have the best memory but I know for sure I put it there! They even told me that other students turned in notecards but they were able to find them so how come mine wasn‚Äôt there? Surprise surprise, two weeks comes and a stack of notecards that may have been left by the class before us was left and they go through it. I swear they may have found it then in that pile as our grade was changed into ‚Äòexcused.‚Äô I‚Äôm okay with that and they emailed me and my friend about it saying ‚ÄòI changed your grade about this‚Äô but never explained why? It‚Äôs just an assumption though or maybe the fact I was answering almost every question they asked the class since no one wanted to answer but it‚Äôs just a hunch. Still, I didn‚Äôt appreciate the fact they called us both liars when we both turned it in. It cost us a grade. And they even told us we don‚Äôt take his class seriously. I‚Äôve attended their class every single day I had them and did their assignments and readings. Other students don‚Äôt even show up to class. 

But today, I was experiencing abdominal pain (period cramps) and the pain pill wasn‚Äôt kicking in but I still went to their class. I went to their class to do the assignment at least even though it was unbearable. After finishing it, I talked to them before class was going to officially start. I told them I was in pain and that if I could leave, even apologized for having to leave early, which I never do (leave early). 
They said ‚Äòyou‚Äôve only been here for 8mins, that doesn‚Äôt count as attendance.‚Äô
‚ÄòSir I am in pain right now but I still did your assignment. How will that not count?‚Äô
‚Äò8mins isn‚Äôt a class period but if you need to go, go ahead.‚Äô So I went in disbelief that, not only that my assignment wasn‚Äôt going to count (apparently to them) but that their attendance was way more important than my health. 

I understand it‚Äôs just a grade and maybe I‚Äôm overthinking this but I would like to report just to see what can be done. My grades aren‚Äôt the best which is why I attend to at least give it a boost. But after what they‚Äôve done and said, I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on or how to approach this. I‚Äôve had them before and I know their teaching styles and what they expect of me, and I‚Äôm doing just that. But to lose my notecard not once, but twice and later call me a liar for claiming I turned it in and other students turned in notecards and got their grades?? Even go as far as seeing past my period cramps to basically say your attendance is more important? 
Is this even okay? If not, who can I go report them to in the biology department? Or should I go for a one on one (even if my confrontational skills aren‚Äôt the best)?

UNCC_CompSci,"Hello everyone,

I have an opportunity to share with those interested in teaching computer science concepts to middle schoolers for¬†**Concentration Technical Elective credits**. 

I am working alongside a CCI professor to expand a program we have been working on for the last couple of years. Our program consists of a collaboration between Charlotte and the Wilson STEM Academy, a magnet middle school in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg¬†school district. We are looking for students who are¬†**comfortable with or¬†willing to learn¬†block-based programming (Scratch) and/****OR**¬†**basic Python programming**. Charlotte students will have the opportunity to teach programming with a¬†*pre-made curriculum*¬†to excited, enthusiastic middle schoolers who are interested in CS!¬†These sessions are run by several UNCC students, so you will not be teaching alone! 

Charlotte CS students will be able to sign up for a¬†**2-credit 3000-level ITCS course**, which fulfills the¬†**Concentration Technical Elective**¬†requirement for Computer Science majors.¬†I estimate that a student will be required to participate in one 1-hour tutoring session per week. *Expect a time commitment* ***no greater*** *than any other 2-credit ITCS course.*

If anyone is interested in learning more about this course, please reach out to me here on Reddit or through my email at¬†[**cpetro@uncc.edu**](mailto:cpetro@uncc.edu)**.**

j0emorris,"Hey everyone,

For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is a member of the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y‚Äôall on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. You may be familiar with Dick Beekman providing y‚Äôall with updates. He has become swamped with work so I will keep y‚Äôall updated frequently. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.

**Mental Health-** As a result of the recent tragedies at UNC Chapel Hill, Charlotte is striving to make all students comfortable with discussing mental health and aware of mental health services around campus. A few things we are currently working on in Student Government to aid students mental health are as follows:¬†

* Mental health days are being discussed at the system level. Mental health days implemented into the University‚Äôs calendar would allow students a day to rest and collect themselves mentally from the pressures and stresses of college level courses. This is a difficult topic however, because students do not plan when they may have a mental health crisis. Therefore, it is understandable that students should be able to take mental health days like a sick day at a time where they deem it necessary. However, this may also become an issue for professors with large classrooms because if multiple students need a mental health day during something important, this causes a major inconvenience for mass rescheduling. Student Government will always represent the students view and will remain doing so throughout the discussion of mental health days.
* Student Assistance and Support Services (SASS) needs to be able to excuse absences for mental health reasons. Currently, many professors are understanding of mental health; however, in the case of a professor not excusing an absence for mental health reasons, Dick Beekman believes that SASS should be able to override the absence and make it excused on a case-by-case basis.
* Allowing students the ability to schedule mental health related appointments through the internet in addition to making appointments over the phone. This erases a barrier which is currently prevalent in people getting mental help. This barrier is having to discuss over the phone that you are seeking help. Students who schedule online will not only have the convenience and speed of the internet, but they will also not have to face this barrier of another human.

**Dining on Campus-** As many of you may be aware, dining hours have not been clearly communicated to students recently, especially over Fall break. Student Government is working on ensuring the hours and closings of dining spots are more clear to students. Along with this, we are also working on securing the opening of dining halls during future breaks. Because a decent amount of students remain on campus during breaks, dining halls should remain open and their hours should be clear. I understand that it would be convenient if dining halls were consistently open; however, due to the low demand of students on campus and the fact that the staff would like to go home during holidays, it should be understandable as to why dining hall hours may be limited during holiday breaks. We are currently focused on continuity and clarity of dining hall hours over non-holiday breaks. In addition to the work we are doing in these areas, I wanted to provide a reminder of services such as the Jamil Niner Student Pantry and the weekly university provided shuttle that can help students prepare in advance of any and all dining hall closures. .

**Tuition and Fees Advisory Board-** For those of you who are unaware, the Tuition and Fees Advisory Board (TFAB) is responsible for discussing the costs of tuition and fees for students for the upcoming year. In the past, TFAB consisted completely of students, but the University was made aware that this was in violation of system policy and faculty and staff needed to be members of the board. An initial proposal was created by administration which suggested that the TFAB would consist of a slight majority of faculty and staff, while students made up a slight minority. Student Government felt that this was unfair as the tuition and fees remains mainly a student issue. This is because the current financial burden of college is better understood by those undertaking the burden of any increases rather than the faculty or staff. The Student Government worked with Chancellor Gaber to shift the proportion of students to faculty and staff in the TFAB. Chancellor Gaber was very understanding of our concerns and she allowed us to shift the board to a 50/50 split between students and faculty/staff. The tie breaking vote will go to Chancellor Gaber.

I understand that it may be strange receiving these updates from someone other than Dick, but I am very excited to take on the role. I am also very excited to get to meet the Reddit community as a whole. Since I am new here, I thought y‚Äôall should know some basic information about me. I am from Charlotte and I am a freshman. I was in SGA in high school and I am thrilled to be given the same opportunity in college. I am also a political science and environmental studies double major. As a member of Student Government, I will always fight to ensure every student has their voice and opinion heard. If you have any questions/concerns or you just want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out anytime via email at jmorr151@uncc.edu. I can also meet up in person for more prominent issues if necessary, I have a flexible schedule. Thank you so much for this opportunity to serve y‚Äôall as a whole.

I'm done with the oppression, labels, shame, and money. The fact that I'm afraid that if I drop out to breathe for my children, society has failed them not me. The fact if the leaders of the this community can't understand my pain, then keep your diplomas, voting polls, your syntax, and your syllabus I don't need it.

WALK SIGN IS ON....GREEN LIGHT GO

Don't let mSR\_qNINER be the only one that taught me how to put a mask on my face to protect my children. My home is an array for my children's love.

Put down your false variables. I'm tired of hearing who I smoke. SMOKE GREEN NOT ME. Read between the lines. Love isn't binary anymore. Wake up.

If the LEADERS of any community are becoming ink demons and are getting bent. Then SCREAM.

SQUID GAME

If you call me ""Sick"" and I need ""God"", my God is HEXA! The squid in the in the sea/

If you care share...if the NOUNS of this community want to hide my message of love for my children, I want the artists of the world to tell the kids how I felt through my warrior's journey. My Zelda needs to remember what her robin tried to do for her.

NINERS if you feel oppressed by rocks of society, pick up pickaxes and smash them to pieces. Love shouldn't be a puzzle in life.

If you see any of my struggles let my kids know you see them. My eyes are too clouded with tears to see.

I SEE YOU

I've left ""easter eggs"" in my message. If you want to try and figure who I am. Just know this one thing...I'm down with the pew. I'm just trying to find FRIENDS that are down too. NEVER DOX MY CHILDREN.

Robsaurusrex,"If you can relate to my own dread for math classes. Just know you're not alone. People hawk and hawk on the importance of math in comp sci which I get. It's just my brain doesn't work with memorization. I can't beat multiple formulas in my head before a midterm. Every math class I pass  big fat C. Don't get me wrong I've made it this far in life, I know what it takes. If you're a math tutor I've probably bugged the crap out of you every week. I even switched my major from Software Engineering to Information Technology in hopes of Statistics being easier. No, its just more endless terminology and theories that I'll never use.   


I thought starting college was hard but man finishing when your so close is even more difficult. At 31 I feel that pressure to finish. Like take my wife for example, she is just so ecstatic for me to finish, but I don't know if I can get through Stat II. I'm struggling in logic and algorithms and it comes off easy. The fear to fail is great at times. I hate the way our modern education is set up to be so impersonal and so cookie cut. All I want is a successful career to support my family. I'm better than wal-mart or papa johns.  


I'm in the process of speaking to a professor and my advisor to see what I can do to cut back a couple of credits. I've learned to know when I'm defeated and to pull it back a bit. Many of you are so young and have your whole 20's to look forward too. I just finished my 20's and still feel like a mess of an adult. I'm just all over the place.  


It's funny when I was 20 I would think about when I was gonna start feeling like an adult. I finally found the answer after a decade. At some point in life I realized that I was just too dam busy to worry about if I'm doing it right. Just try your best and move on to the next. We're gonna fall and make mistakes.  


I know there are a few out there like me that struggle with mental health. What I've learned is communication and finding your support group is important. I can't express how much I appreciate this sub reddit and discord servers. Thank you so much for accepting us older students. Even if you call me boomer all the time ;)  


Sorry to get so dark and deep on you guys but I'm fine trust me. I just feel beaten and looking for some Niner pride. Go out and enjoy life! I reached out to some old friends back 10 years ago just to see how they were doing and talk about our kids. Treasure these moment you guys are having. I wish I had been smarter and went to UNCC back in 09'.  


I love our community and make sure you guys are looking out for each other. Oh also I'm not an english major so my grammar and writing is all over the place but I don't really care. We have a few lurking haters in this subreddit. Just trying to spread love here.

However, I'm a student that lives on campus with quite the tight schedule and a very introverted personality. But you know what is the best part of my days so far? Going outside, putting my phone down, and sitting near the fountain near the Library.

Guys, a lot of us are very young and very stressed out by our chaotic and technologically dominated world. It is very therapeutic to just slow down and enjoy the beautiful campus we have every once in a while. Whenever we win a football game or if it's a perfectly day for a walk, people just stay in their dorm rooms and that isn't very healthy.

I brought up the subject the other day to a few fellow students and offered to go with them to relax and enjoy the scenery, and they were pretty hostile about it. I 100% understand that everyone has their own schedule and need their alone time, but find time out of your week to appreciate a good long stroll or sit-down at a garden or something. Your brain could use the release.

Have fun and take a long look at your surroundings here while you can, or you'll regret not ""stopping and smelling the roses"". And bring a friend if you can.

1. Actually distributing the candy. It seems like we will either have a designated table or maybe that with people walking around handing it out or just multiple tables. So it seems likely we will need some help in doing that!

2. Helping with the supply of candy. I‚Äôm gonna try my best but I can only buy so much and with the food bank also in the plan it would be nice to have a good supply. 

3. Picking the food bank! As a freshman I am not super knowledgeable about the area, so if anybody knows about the best food bank/charity to work through that would be nice.

4. An editor for an advertisement we can post on our Instagram stories and such, and maybe an artist that would like to make a banner for the table/multiple tables!

5. Just promoting it at all! If you aren‚Äôt able to help with the actual process a simple post of that advertisement I mentioned would be great! The goal is to spread some fall spirit on campus and give to a good cause with all the extra candy so a story post or anything promoting it would be great!",UNCCharlotte,looking for people interested in a on-campus Halloween candy hand out and donating to a local food bank!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/pznr7c/looking_for_people_interested_in_a_oncampus/,pznr7c,10,3,"10/01/2021, 23:46:59"

CatDaddy27,"This last year, we students were forced to experience one of the most overwhelming and confusing times we may have to live through. The university didn‚Äôt believe it was necessary to keep us in the loop and was not understanding after making impulsive decisions that drastically changed our everyday lives. As SGA underclassman senator, I will make sure that the university has a plan in place in case anything like this is to continue or happen again, and we aren‚Äôt left to fend for ourselves. Secondly, the school‚Äôs inability to provide meals to students in a timely manner is unacceptable. I would like to explore the possibilities that the campus may implement to help in cutting wait times for food, such as bringing back to-go meals from Crown and SoVi. As our campus continues to grow, so do the many backgrounds and ethnicities of our student body. Creating a day for local food trucks to provide authentic meals would be a great way to showcase the identities of our campus. Lastly, I want to utilize the vast amount of open spaces the campus has to offer for frequent entertainment and exciting activities including yoga and tailgating at no cost for all of us to take a break after a long day. I also have noticed how helpful it is to have our student body president, Dick Beekmen, to post updates to this page. I would like to do the same about everything happening on campus, and expand SGA‚Äôs social media presence to provide more frequent updates. 

Since 6th grade, I‚Äôve known my goal in life is to create effective change and since have tried to do anything I can to stand up to injustice and develop my leadership skills. I am currency the vice president of Kappa Alpha Order, a new fraternity on campus, that I have had the pleasure to help build from the ground up. As well as VP, I am the chairmen of the brotherhood committee, new member education, and formally diversity and inclusion. While I was in high school, I was chosen by the American Legion to be a part of New York‚Äôs unique Boys‚Äô State, run by the U.S. Marines, training us to become professional leaders. I also placed 2nd in a business partnership state competition for Future Bussiness leaders of America, qualifying for the national competition. My school lacked any political club, so I started our first Model United Nations club, taking us to two conferences. Additionally, as a senior, I led a movement against my school board, to prevent the termination of our principal, during which I had to speak in front of my city officials, school board, the media, and our entire city. When speaking out didn‚Äôt work, I was willing to escalate my cause, and started sit-in protests and marches, resulting in the resignation of our superintendent. Just as I wasn‚Äôt afraid of speaking out against them, I won‚Äôt be afraid to call out the school when they do something they shouldn‚Äôt, as well as help find solutions to fix the problem.

They took all my clothes out from my dresser and I have to refold them, but that's fair honestly. Still frustrating though. Ugh.

Anyways, I brought all my non-essential stuff because, long story short, I have a pre-operation appointment this Thursday I have to leave tomorrow night for. So I wanted to basically opposite pack. As in, I pack the things I DON'T need and then move them back to my dorm, stay at temp housing for tonight with my essentials, then pack up my remaining stuff and leave tomorrow night. That way I can just come back on Friday evening and unpack and boom, it's done.

EveninqSkies,"So my sister (who I have not been in contact with) came into contact with a kid who tested positive with COVID.

I'm planning on going home for a pre-op appointment later this week, come back, and then go back home for my surgery next week. If she gets tested this week and comes back negative I'll go home and basically quarantine in my room and make sure not to spend time with her or use the same bathrooms or anything. I'll be getting tested myself two days before my surgery and I might try to get tested before I go back to campus just to double check. Otherwise, I'll ask a family friend to stay at their place while I'm back home.

I'm assuming that if I go to my house, as long she continues to test negative I'll be good to come back, correct? And if she tests positive I gotta quarantine for two weeks. Which sucks but it is what it is.

Should just go with the family friend immediately? 

I'm not really sure what my best option is, both for me and for the UNCC community. I don't want to put y'all at risk but I sort of need to get this to work out lol.

fishfearme122,"Hello everyone! My name is Christian Rios and I'm currently the DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) chair in senate for Student Government Association. I've used reddit before but decided to make a new account to post updates on things that **I** and my committee works on. I'm not speaking for all of senate or Student Government as whole. For people who don't what committees are, in senate to help make things more efficient we divide senators into group and from they focus on certain issues (Academic, Internal, Student, etc). Committee chairs are voted internally in senate to lead this committees, push initiatives and work with other branches and committees to help increase productive. DEI specifically works on improving conditions and voices for minority, underrepresented and marginalized students on campus.

That introduction being said, I'm here to talk about a project I'm doing for Hispanic Heritage Month. Hispanic heritage month lasts from September 15- October 15 and we honor the contributions and influences of Hispanics in history, culture, art, scientific achievements and so much more. To honor hispanics we made a post on the Student Government instagram page (@uncc\_sga) with some information on what Hispanic Heritage Month and some famous Hispanics in history. Furthermore from now on, every week we're going to be selecting Hispanic students here at UNC Charlotte to tell us about their experiences as a Hispanic student, what it means to be Hispanic, and their hopes and dreams for the Hispanic community! We need volunteers so if you identify as your ethnicity as Hispanic or know of people who might be interested, please fill the form out below so we can select you to get highlighted.

Other things DEI committee has been working on has been adding DEI modules to the SOAR orientation. While the finer details such as the content inside the module have yet to be worked out, the conservation has been started with the faculty in charge of SOAR so stay tuned for update on that.

That's it! stay tuned on my account for updates, I'll try to do them weekly. If you have concerns, suggestions or any questions please feel free to reach out. My email is [crios8@uncc.edu](mailto:crios8@uncc.edu), you can direct message me here, and I'm always willing to try to help! Hope everyone has a good Monday and a good week!

WeWantDick,"Hi Y'all,

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I wanted to come on here and provide y‚Äôall with some things on my radar this week.

**COVID-19-** I wanted to share what‚Äôs currently on my radar regarding COVID-19. Based on conversations with System Office officials, the System Office expects the week of the 26th to be the projected peak. So the bad news is that we‚Äôre not quite yet at the peak. The good news is, we‚Äôre almost there and we haven‚Äôt seen drastic changes to our semester. Mecklenburg County continues to have an 11.4% positivity rate, yet we‚Äôve managed to keep our positivity rate at 1.8% in comparison. Our high vaccination rates (74% for all students in F2F classes) and compliance with the mask mandate is a big reason for this, and as we get through the peak I want y‚Äôall to know that your support in these areas is what has helped make this in-person semester a success.

**Student Government Elections-** Voting opens up this week for various different Senate positions as well as Freshman Class President. Tomorrow, you should get an email directing you to vote.uncc.edu to select who you want to represent you. I would really encourage you to participate in elections, and make your voice heard for who you believe deserves the role. This is the most competitive election cycle that I‚Äôve seen during my time in Student Government, and every vote truly does matter.

**75th Anniversary-** This week marks the 75th anniversary of Charlotte‚Äôs founding, with Founder‚Äôs Day coming up on the 23rd. If you haven‚Äôt heard so already, classes are cancelled on Thursday in observation of this day. A list of various different events can be found [here](https://inside.charlotte.edu/news-features/2021-09-13/celebration-75-years-making), and I‚Äôll give a shameless plug for the Meet and Greet with Chancellor Gaber hosted by Student Government from 1-2:30. We‚Äôll be giving out shirts and sweets, so I hope to see y‚Äôall there.

**Ways to Get Involved-** Student Government currently has a couple of opportunities to get involved, and both of these opportunities are open to all students, regardless if you‚Äôre a member of Student Government or not. The first is the Dining Services Committee. As we‚Äôve seen over the past month, there are a lot of concerns surrounding dining services on campus. This committee works closely with my Secretary for Business Affairs, Ross Landgraf, as well as Chartwells and Dining Services to enhance the on campus dining experience. The application can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRpJVR3xo_GfTjDYvr4T1zi3NlRM1k_IB50V0PBwJPSuDHNw/viewform) The second opportunity is the Police and Public Safety Advisory Board, headed by my Secretary for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Jeremiah Williams. This board works closely with campus police to advise on ways to keep our campus safe while creating an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect between officers and those they serve. The application can be found [here.](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/submitter/form/start/469798)

It‚Äôs hard to believe this week marks one month since FDOC. As we continue to go through the semester, I want to stress that my door is always open for any questions, comments, or concerns. I can be reached either via email at [rbeekman@uncc.edu](mailto:rbeekman@uncc.edu), or through my office hours [via Zoom](https://uncc.zoom.us/j/97289218520)**.** My office hours are 1:30-2:30 Monday through Friday, but please be aware that previous appointments have priority over drop in, so it may be worth shooting me a quick email to check if I‚Äôm free before popping in. If those hours do not work for you, please let me know and I will do everything I can to work around your schedule. As always, thank you for the continued privilege of serving as your Student Body President. Stay safe, stay masked, and Go Niners.",UNCCharlotte,SGA Update 9/20,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/prvs8z/sga_update_920/,prvs8z,41,2,"09/20/2021, 10:15:48"

strugglingstudent00,"I'm a senior at UNC Charlotte and since I transferred here in 2019 there has been this vibe of ""you gotta be self sufficient to do well here"" and while I think that is healthy in college it is overboard at UNCC. Meeting people is difficult since so many students are commuters, events are either never announced or have such bad communication around them not many people know about them, and progressing through your coursework feels very isolating since few faculty are willing to help you when you reach out(from my personal experience).

Maybe this is because Ive basically had 3 out of 4 semesters ruined by covid but I hear these same complaints from almost everyone I talk to about these aspects of the school.

Get student body exited to vote. 
Anything else you can think off.

*** this is not a partisan group nor does it intent to be. We will be try to be  in contact with any candidate  that will let us, and we will spread information on the candidates that are based on facts and past voting history***

**Dining Services-** Those of y'all who have tried eating on campus recently probably aren't surprised I'm leading with this one. I mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/pcd80k/sga_dining_services_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) some first steps we were taking to help alleviate the problem. Unfortunately, the issues surrounding on campus dining remain. My Secretary for Business Services, Ross Landgraf, is meeting with Dining Services with an intent to push for more to be done regarding the situation. Some, but not all, of the recommendations we're looking to implement include expanding the to go option for Crown beyond simply when they're at maximum capacity, bringing in food trucks to help alleviate the strain on dining establishments, and prioritizing hiring at either Crown or Sovi so that at least one dining hall can expand their hours to provide more times for students to eat. Behind only COVID-19, this has been the most pressing issue on campus in my opinion. I've spoken with a number of y'all over the past couple of weeks and heard firsthand the struggles you're facing. As a student myself, I'm facing the same struggles, and wanted to assure you that this issue isn't being simply written off. While it is true that every year we experience longer waits at the beginning of the semester, I don't know that we've ever experienced a situation this bad. I do also want to emphasize that dining services truly is working tirelessly alongside of us to come up with a solution. Just the other day, I found Sarah Lynch, the Resident District Manager for Chartwells, up to her elbows washing out blenders at Shake Smart. I say this to illustrate that all of dining services truly understands the severity of the issue, and we are all working to find a solution that works. Patience is hard in this situation, and by no means am I saying your frustrations are invalid. I would give a shameless plug that the issue at hand is not the result of the individuals behind the counter. Quite the opposite, they are working hard towards being the solution. As someone who's first job was in food service, I wanted to share that reminder on their behalf.Regardless, y'all are struggling, and that is heard. Ross and I are working diligently on this topic, and we are truly trying everything we can think of to address this issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19-** COVID-19 continues to be constantly monitored and discussed on truly a daily, if not hourly basis. As many of y'all may be aware, last week we had our second COVID cluster identified. I said it then, and I want to reiterate it again now: COVID clusters are going to happen this semester. Our goal is not the elimination of risk entirely, it is the mitigation of risk as much as possible. Were we trying to completely eliminate risk, the answer would be simple. We would be online, back home, with no in-person events. That is not the goal here. The goal is to have an in-person semester as safely as possible. That means we're going to have to take some steps back to preserve our semester. That means wearing masks indoors, complying with testing protocols, not going to class if you feel sick, getting the COVID-19 vaccine, and more. Even outdoors, when in large crowds, I would encourage all students to wear their masks to help slow the spread. We are not out of the woods yet with this pandemic. Far from it. The latest date that was thrown out to me was the week of September 26th for the peak. That means we still have some ways to go. As we get closer to the projected peak, as the situation continues to change, we will adjust accordingly. That doesn't mean we're about to move online, that doesn't mean the situation is deteriorating beyond the point of control. It simply means we're being proactive in mitigating this pandemic. I understand the fears, and your concerns are absolutely valid. But I wanted to throw this out there to help alleviate any fears that we may be on the brink of shifting everything online. We are not, and if we get to that point, I will let y'all know.

&amp;#x200B;

**Athletics-** On to a happier topic! Unless you've been living under a rock, we beat Duke on Friday! This was a huge win for our program, and if you're reading this with any ties to the football team, thank you for all the hard work you've done to make this moment a reality. I briefly spoke with Chancellor Gaber the day following the win, and emphasized to her that for the first time in 19 months, I saw our student body genuinely happy and care free. That meant a lot to me, and I know it means even more to y'all. I did want to give a friendly plug for our other sports as well. Women's volleyball just won the Windy City Classic in Chicago, women's soccer has been absolutely fire at home this season, and men's soccer just had a huge come from behind last minute win against Seattle to move to 2-1 for the season. We have a great sports program here at Charlotte, and while we absolutely need to keep this energy level up in football, let's keep it up for our other sports as well.

This is obviously three highlights out of many. At last count, my cabinet alone (not including the rest of Student Government), has 69 various initiatives going on right now. I look forward to the day where I'm able to talk about something not COVID related, but until then this is the unfortunate reality. If you have any questions about the topics mentioned above, feel free to comment below. If you have any questions or observations about any issues on campus, still feel free to comment below. Odds are someone is currently working on it in some capacity, and if they aren't, we can get started on it. I know this remains a difficult start to the new semester, especially with issues relating to health and food security. I hear your concerns, I share in your concerns, and while I can't snap my fingers and simply make them go away, I promise you that my team is doing everything we can to work tirelessly on your behalf to alleviate these issues.

EveninqSkies,"I ended up actually coming up with a game plan that I like and my parents both agree with it. :)

Double major. Art (not Fine, just Art) and Computer Science. I want to learn how to make 3d models and the like so I can go into the Gaming/AI/Robotics concentration for that and do some classes in my Art major too. 

I get connections and networking in both fields. I get two degrees (which might mean I get paid more). I only stay an extra semester or maybe a full year, which means I STILL graduate in either four years or less (thanks AP and dual enrollment!). I still have the opportunity to do animation or character design, but I also have something to fall back on in case that doesn't work and keep trying until it does. I'm valuable in the gaming industry due to my ability to be both a programmer and a designer. I can communicate better with teammates. 

I'll have to work hard and grind my ass off, but I can do it. I know I can. So thank you guys for making me consider the possibility that doing both what I want and what my parents want isn't exactly impossible. I knew it was possible to do a double major but I didn't realize how feasibly I could do it. Nor how many doors it opens for me.

It felts like I had a eureka moment. Like everything clicked into place. I feel so much calmer now. Less stressed. Happier. Lighter.

This isn't a you go to detention and come back to school the next time, there could be real consequences for this if they find out its you. All of this with the fact that it's been hard enough for our food service people as it is without having to remake food or watch to see if people are stealing. If you need help that bad talk to financial services or ask the people around you for help. This isn't the way to do it and even if you somehow don't get caught it's still a shitty thing to do.

stinkyjack,"It's 8:30 PM, you're starting to feel a bit peckish. You check the hours of the dining options on campus. Nothing is open past 8 PM. Huh, that's pretty weird, you think, we're college kids not senior citizens. Whatever, you're not that hungry anyway and bedtime is soon enough. Time passes, you're getting pretty hungry. At this point, if you don't have a car to drive to a restaurant, you're pretty much faced with the choice of paying $20+ for delivery for a single meal or commuting to a fast food joint for a half hour one-way. Well, you don't feel like doing either of those and don't have a car, at least you have vending machines to tide you over until the morning, right? Wrong. They only work when the vending machine gods allow it. You use a card in one of the Oak Hall vending machines to get a soda and then try to use the same card to get a snack from the vending machine literally right next to it and it doesn't work. Huh. Well, hey, sometimes you just gotta go to bed hungry, y'know? You can eat a nice hefty breakfast in the morning.


You wake up at 8:00 AM, take a shower, check the weather, get ready, all while thinking of that sweet sweet breakfast you're about to indulge in. You get to Crown Commons at 9 am (I've been there as early as 7:30 AM, same situation), expecting to quench the hunger you've been subjected to for the past 14+ hours, only to find that there's pretty much no food - half of the booths (I don't know what else to call them) are closed, and the ones that are open serve very limited food options. You eat some yogurt with some fruit, thinking you'll get actual food for lunch. Come in again between 4 and 5 PM, same thing happens. Huge lines and no food. Why can't there be huge food and no lines??? You can't even numb the pain with your favorite sugary drink because the gosh darn soda fountains keep running out of soda... Oh well, you eat what you can find and grab a couple chocolate chip cookies on your way out.

You sit in your room and do your homework like a good student. You feel rumbling in your stomach. You check the time. It's 8:30 PM.

Why yes, I did write this whole thing lying hungry in bed at 1:30 AM, how could you tell?

I hope you enjoyed my little tale of woe, but in all seriousness this food stuff is starting to get out of hand. I'm not even gonna talk about the quality of the food or the single use plates and cutlery that we have to use. (Like have any of y'all tried sticking a plastic fork into one of the chicken nuggets at CC?)

This is my actual daily experience with food on campus, with an overpriced daily meal plan that I was FORCED to purchase. I know I'm not the only one. We need to do something about this ASAP.

EveninqSkies,"I've... come to the realization that I truly enjoy art more than anything else that could be offered here (I'm pretty sure), and that I'm honestly considering the possibility to pursue a degree in Art to go into character design.

There have been a few other degrees (ie. bioinformatics or genetics) I've considered that I know my parents will approve of more, and while I may need some more time to decide on that because they are legitimately interesting topics, right now I want to consider the possibility of what happens if I want to go against my parents' wishes.

My mom's been taking out PLUS loans to pay for my schooling and she's the one that would likely agree to me doing an art degree, so that's not too much of a problem (I'll just live below my means for a bit to help out with those loans and my own student loans)... but my parents' relationship is precarious right now and I'm worried that they'll get into an argument about it and destroy any semblance or normalcy they might have right now.

I know my dad only wants the best for me so that's why he pushes for something more STEM related, but I can't force myself to do something I'm not meant for. I'd rather enjoy my job and maybe struggle a little than be well-off but miserable. And that's something my dad struggles to grasp because he's hating struggling his whole life and he's miserable living the way he is without a college degree that can get him a good job and he doesn't want that for me.

Maybe I could double major, but I can't force my mom in good conscience to get more loans for that, so I have to hurry and job hunt for something good that will allow me to save enough money to make that move but I'm taking 5 classes right now so I don't have much flexibility.

I also just don't know if I'm good enough for this, to be frank. What if my art isn't good enough to make it? It's such a competitive field that despite my dad loving my artwork and encouraging me to create more, I can see why he'd be hesitant about me pursuing it as a career.

Art majors, or anyone whose parents disagreed with their major, do you guys have any tips?

(Note: please do not hate on my dad, he cares about me a lot and he's just worried about me. I consider him both a father and a friend. He's changed a lot from when I was a child and shown that he accepts criticism with his parenting so he's not an awful parent.)",UNCCharlotte,"If your parents disapproved of your major, how did you persuade them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/pgr50q/if_your_parents_disapproved_of_your_major_how_did/,pgr50q,15,15,"09/02/2021, 17:27:13"
tillSb2S3,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub for a while and figured I‚Äôd make a post. I‚Äôm attending a community college in NC currently and plan to transfer to UNCC next fall. I‚Äôve done a little research and UNCC is a school I‚Äôm really set on. I was hoping some of you could drop some comments about the program I specified in the title of the post or about what UNCC is like in general as a school. I know it‚Äôs reccomend that I should pick from a variety of schools just in case, but I just feel really drawn to UNCC. One thing I‚Äôm a little worried about is my GPA. It‚Äôs currently 2.7 because I did a semester in 2016 and dropped out for a while. I got serious and last semester I made 3 A‚Äôs and a B. Not sure what that averages out to because it was at a different school. Hopefully if I do well this semester it‚Äôll bring up the 2.7 at the school I‚Äôm currently attending.

Lefty6817,"I have a residential parking pass and am currently parked in north deck. The other day I drove in and saw a sign that says that apparently I need to move my car before Friday because of the football game or I get towed. So when I check where I can park, I find out that like half the residential parking spots on campus are also allotted to  football parking... so I have no idea where in the hell me and everyone else in north deck are going to park our cars... I know they say south deck is open but the last time I was there it was packed to the brim.... I guess I better hope that some people leave for labor day weekend a day early so I can steal their parking spot...

PhoenixAlano,"(This might sound like a rant so I‚Äôm sorry in advance if it does).
Over the past week and the week before the FDOC, I‚Äôve seen too many posts either joking about returning back to full online and/or fearing the thought of going back to full online. This needs to stop. Nobody wants to see a repeat over last year and in my opinion it does not look anywhere close to the situation last year. Last year we had no vaccine, this year we do.
Our vaccination rate is over 70% and projected to increase. No I‚Äôm not saying that vaccines completely protects from getting the virus but it greatly reduces the chances of actually getting it and actually receiving any symptoms at all. 99.8% of the people who are hospitalized and even killed are the unvaccinated. So not only we‚Äôre we told in the beginning that the vaccines are both SAFE and EFFICIENT, but we are seeing it through actual covid statistics all across the country. All of these ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give us a week‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give us a month‚Äù comments are spreading fear to students not only on this subreddit but others as well. You are deteriorating their hopes to a (semi) normal college experience and education face to face. 
I understand the need to meme the situation but you might just be doing more harm than good. Our Student government has been phenomenal this year and they will be the first to let us know what the situation will be. Covid spikes were bound to happen and I‚Äôm sure that the school and SGA anticipated it. As long as we have the vaccine and take the protocols to quarantine, there is literally no reason to be AS fearful as we were a year ago.

TLDR: stop spreading fear of the virus. Stop spreading fear of going back to online.

AlcoholicEmbryo,"Hello, anyone that can help I would very much appreciate it.

I am a computer science major and just started my 5th semester here at UNCC. I am on a good track to finish the CS portion of my degree, but am confused about elective courses from outside my concentration? 

I have decided I want to take a few random electives to fulfill the ""Elective Courses Outside Concentration"" section of Degree Works. Some classes appear greyed out, as seen below for **ANTH-1101** and **ANTH-2144**. I know that a **SOCY 3XXX** class I took also shows up greyed in that box when I disable this semester's classes on Degreeworks. This confirms to me that all 3 of these courses are counting towards my ""Additional 15 Credit Hours"" required by the CS degree (?).

This semester, I signed up for **SOCY-1101** in addition to **ANTH-2144** to fill more of that additional 15 credit hour requirement. However, I do not see the **SOCY-1101** label greyed out inside of this box. I cannot find it anywhere counting towards a credit category on Degreeworks, except at the bottom of the page where it lists all the courses I am registered for this semester. How can I check that this course is counting towards my degree progress? All my general education is complete.

WeWantDick,"Hi Y'all,

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. While my updates were planned for only once a week, developing events regarding dining services has caused me to feel it important to come on here and share some information with you.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of you are already aware of the ongoing issues with dining on campus. Long wait times have been reported at virtually every dining location. While there are many legitimate causes for this (staffing issues, high demand with the new year, decreased hours due to resources and staff), this has remained a concern nonetheless. Earlier tonight u/btror made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/pc9z9t/a_suggestion_to_improve_things_please_do_this_sga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that I thought provided a well thought out solution. My Secretary for Business Services Ross Landgraf and I committed to looking into this, and we did just that.

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy to say that after speaking with Auxiliary Services, to go options will now be offered at Crown. Students will have the option of picking up a to go container and taking it with them to hopefully free up tables and provide more opportunities for students to eat. This will help not just dining, but also help mitigate COVID-19. Auxiliary Services has also assured me that Crown2Go will also be opening up next week, and this will only further help the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the staffing issues, Auxiliary Services is in the process of onboarding 50+ people. This will hopefully result in quicker service. Again, all of America is facing a staffing issue right now. Charlotte is no exception. However, this issue has been identified on multiple levels, advocated for, and is being addressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to personally thank everyone who has been patient and understanding throughout this process. While the beginning of the semester tends to be incredibly busy, it has been clear that the effects of this pandemic have only made this worse. Posts like the one made by u/btror highlight exactly why I believe so strongly in outreach and engagement with students. It truly was a great suggestion, and I am not nearly smart enough to have come up with it on my own. I hope this suggestion and its quick implementation continue to build your faith in your student representatives. While we can't solve all the worlds problems overnight, I hope this serves as proof that your voices, concerns, frustrations, and ideas are genuinely heard and acted upon. As we continue to onboard more individuals for our dining operations, I urge patience, compassion, and understanding as we work through this situation together. Thank you for your continued support, and as always, thank you for the continued privilege of serving as your Student Body President.

btror,"So the food situation, especially at Crown, is whack this year. I've been here for 3 years and I've never seen Crown so packed before. Sometimes I can't even find a table because it's so packed. Clearly, this is a problem because it's annoying to stand around with a plate of food and wait for a table to clear up, but also because it isn't practical to have so many people in one place with Delta going around. 

I have a simple solution though. Why not just give us plastic to-go plates when we go in? Let us stuff it with some food and go eat somewhere else. A lot of people like myself would just do that and take food back to our dorms, and the people who would want to stay at Crown would be more likely to find a table to sit at AND it helps with the COVID situation.

Seems like a simple solution to multiple problems. Hits 3 birds with 1 stone. Can we get this done?

aatt1780,"Hey y‚Äôall! My name is Anvi Tirunagari and I‚Äôm a Student Involvement Ambassador. I‚Äôve been lurking this subreddit and have been seeing a lot of people confused on how to connect with clubs or really just making new friends on campus. I understand going from a shift from high school/community college/ another university to UNCC can be an adjustment, but we have so many resources to help you out.

First off, Niner Engage ([ninerengage.uncc.edu](http://ninerengage.uncc.edu/)) is going to be your best friend. It has all of our 400+ organizations listed. Think of it as a Google search engine for all the orgs on campus. You can search by keywords or scroll through the different categories to find a few clubs that fit you. Each org‚Äôs page usually has basic information and meeting times listed, but if they don‚Äôt there is a feature to message them on the Niner Engage website and they should get back to you. You can also check for their Instagram (a lot of clubs are pretty active on there). There‚Äôs also a news tab where you can find upcoming meetings posted by each org.

But wait! There‚Äôs more. Niner Engage also has an events tab where mostly every event is happening on campus. You can search and filter through a variety of things to find what fits you and your schedule. There are SO SO many events happening, especially because orgs are so excited to be in person again. If you‚Äôre looking to make some new friends that‚Äôs a great place to start.

Another way to find out what‚Äôs happening on campus is to follow our social media. We have a few from the Student Involvement Office that are very active on Instagram and Tiktok! @ CLTinvolvement on Instagram is run by us Student Involvement Ambassadors and has info on the different orgs and how to connect with them. We also have info for clubs to recruit people as well through a number of events throughout the year. @ cabunccharlotte is the Campus Activity Board, which hosts a bunch of small and large-scale events, from painting pots to having artists play concerts on campus.   
@ uncchomecoming is where you will find all of the information on this year‚Äôs homecoming, which will be from October 31st to November 7th. @ uncc\_sga is our Student Government Association (which most of you probably know of from our president‚Äôs active presence on here) and @ gpsguncc is our Graduate and Professional Student Government. Both are strong organizations that work towards representing and advocating for the student body. Again, if you find clubs that you like from Niner Engage or other events, look for them on social media as well, and don‚Äôt be shy to DM them with questions!

Lastly, if you‚Äôre a little stuck on where to start, how to manage your time with orgs, etc. schedule a Get Involved consultation with a Student Involvement Ambassador! We will have a 1-on-1 session discussing any of your questions or concerns (check out [go.uncc.edu/ambassadors](http://go.uncc.edu/ambassadors)). I personally have my sessions from 4-6 pm on Wednesdays, but PM me if you want to have a meeting with another ambassador or have any personal questions. We also have Student Org Officer Consultations for org officers who may need help with membership &amp; retention, conflict management &amp; communication, financial management, event planning, and more.

I hope that helped! If you have any questions, feel free to drop a comment below, PM me, or schedule a consultation with me or another Student Involvement Ambassador!

IThinkElephantsRCute,"I have been a tenant here for the last 3 years. The management has changed recently, and they are the worst. The lady Crystal Wilson is the current manager and her behavior is very rude towards everyone. She keeps the swimming pool closed if she's not in office. The pool was closed all summer, and when I asked her about it, she said that being the manager, she can do anything. So she can even keep the pool open for 1 hr per day, and still technically say she's giving us pool facility.

She had told us they would change our carpet, and that was the reason we had renewed the lease this time. It's been 2 months and they haven't done anything. When I finally confronted her, and told her that this is the worst management, she said she would not take any criticism as they were doing their best. They have not done any repairs since April, but Crystal was very annoyed when I pointed that out. She has told me that she will not change carpet or do any repairs, till I take back my statement that she's a bad manager, and apologize to her.

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I'm trying to post once a week on this sub to provide updates on a variety of topics, so welcome to week one of this. Also, a happy FDOC to y'all, and may your semester be filled with nothing but As. Having said that, here are some updates:

&amp;#x200B;

**In person classes-** Welp, we finally made it to FDOC, and sure enough, we're enjoying an in-person semester. I really want to emphasize however that just because we've gotten to this point, that doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. Delta still remains a threat, and once again I'll emphasize the importance of mask wearing and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. If we want to remain in person, this is still our best chance at ensuring that remains a possibility. Normally I'd post the updated COVID numbers, but Chancellor Gaber is sending those out today, so be on the lookout for that email.

&amp;#x200B;

**New logo-** Another big reveal from this week centered around the new academic logo. Like many other schools in the nation, we felt it important to more closely blend our academic and athletic logo. Further building off of that, we are now in the practice of referring to ourselves as ""Charlotte,"" similar to how UC Berkley refers to themselves as Berkley. As we celebrate our 75th anniversary and begin transitioning to a new chapter in our history, it is the hope of many, including myself, that this rebranding helps take us to the next level.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fall Elections-** Fall elections for Student Government are coming up quickly. If you're interested in getting involved, we will be holding elections for Freshman Class President and various Senate positions. You can sign up to run [here](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/submitter/form/start/488259), and I hope you'll genuinely consider it. Student Government is a great organization to join (obviously I'm biased), and I hope to see some of y'all out at the candidates meeting here in a couple of weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**East Village-** If you are one of the hundreds of students displaced by East Village apartments, please know that first and foremost my heart goes out to you. Dealing with this literally days before FDOC is a difficult situation to say the least. I have been in communication with the school on this matter, and trust me when I say they are monitoring the situation closely with concern. Charlotte has already reached out to inquire more about the accommodations being made, including not just housing, but transportation and meal related as well. For any of you who may need legal resources, [Legal Aid Concord](https://www.legalaidnc.org/) is a free service that has worked with students on tenet-landlord issues in the past. I will note that I am by no means suggesting or implying that legal action should or should not be taken, but simply wanted to provide the resource because I have gotten inquires to available services.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot more that I could include, but in the hopes of making your FDOC a little less busy, I think I'll end there. On a personal note, it has truly been wonderful seeing y'all back. My weekend was filled attending various Gold Rush events, and seeing how happy y'all have been to be in person has truly meant a lot. As we progress through the semester, I want to offer a gentle reminder to take care of yourselves, take advantage of resources such as [CAPS](https://caps.uncc.edu/) (I've got an appointment there today, know that they are a phenomenal resource). Use your Google calendar to stay organized, wash your hands, wear your mask, get the vaccine, and stay safe. Feel free to comment below with any questions, comments, or concerns that you may have, but please allow me some time in responding as I have a busy FDOC as many of y'all do. Thank you again for the continued opportunity to serve as your Student Body President, and as always, Go Niners.",UNCCharlotte,SGA Update 8/23 (Happy FDOC!),https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/p9y4ia/sga_update_823_happy_fdoc/,p9y4ia,50,14,"08/23/2021, 07:45:28"

Fuck-covid69,"What‚Äôs up everyone, 

I know a lot of people think differently in regards to Greek life on campus, or in general, but let me tell you it was the best decision I made in college. 

If you are a freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, transfer... hell whatever your status is... and you don‚Äôt feel satisfied with your college experience, you need to rush. 

Trust me, it is not what you might ‚Äúthink‚Äù it‚Äôs like. It‚Äôs a great way to get involved, get connected and honestly I think it‚Äôs the only thing that is keeping my head on straight with all of this covid bullshit. If your hella bored, and got nothing to do, check it out. See the benefits... hell just go to some events and check it out. There are no strings attached to going to events. 

This is my third year in Greek life. Really give it a try. If you are a male or female and have questions in regards to this please contact me! I can point you in the right direction.

Hi Niners!

‚ÄúI know that we can win. I know that greatness lies in you. But remember from here on in, history has its eyes on you."" That's a lot of pressure Mr. George Washington!

We're back! Happy start of the semester everyone. Are you looking for a fun club? Do you like history? Or movies? Or all of the above? 

And most importantly, the age-old question ... Do you want to be in the room where we watch Hamilton? 

Then join the History Club Thursday August 26th at 6:00pm (the room is Denny 102) and see how the ""ten dollar, Founding Father without a father"" rose from the ""eye of a hurricane"" to become one of the most well-known men in his time and place and how successful he was in protecting his legacy ...

Oh, and how does Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical masterpiece compare to the actual history? Was Hamilton's rise and fall from power this dramatic? What's the truth and what's the fiction? 

Come on by to find out!

And good luck on FDOC!

\- The History Club

P.S. We'll have a table at the Student Org Showcase on-campus this Sunday from 2:30-5pm and UNCC Student Involvement let us takeover their Instagram page today, come check it out :)

SmileyKitKat,"posting this here since lots of cpcc students are now at uncc.  
I signed up to take ACC120-N882 back in April when priority registration started, and I signed up for an online section. Yesterday morning, I decided that I would rather take the class in person, so I signed up for the ACC-120-B630 section. I just went into MyCollege to check my classes and I noticed that the section was in red, it said it was full, and then ""This section is no longer¬†available."" I already dropped the online section I was in before for this in-person one, and it was cancelled and I received no warning, even now I have no email to tell me it was cancelled, and now all the online¬†sections for the course are FULL.   


I don't know what to do. I need this class THIS semester in order to graduate on time in the spring next year. And this isn't even my fault. To this day I have not gotten an email saying the cancelled the in person section I signed up for- in fact, I got confirmation for signing up yesterday too.   


so my question is, because this is CPCCs fault, can/do they put me back into the section I was originally in despite it being full?

Ultimately this post is just a reconfiguration of other posts, but here we go.

Move in can already be a challenging experience for you and your family so uploading the forms now might help things move along for yourself and others. Remind your roommates to do it.

¬∑        Not sure where that one building you‚Äôve never heard of is or how to get there? Simply type in the name of the building in Google Maps and instead of ‚Äòdrive‚Äô select ‚Äòwalk‚Äô route. It will take you through walking routes through the school.

¬∑        There is a [central lost and found](https://police.uncc.edu/community/lost-found), but there each building tends to have an informal lost and found as well.

¬∑        Have some weirdly specific administrative question that needs to be asked but you have no idea what department to contact? Contact [Niner Central](https://ninercentral.uncc.edu/)

Safety

Emergency Phone Number (when calling from cell phone): 704-687-2200

Non-Emergency: 704‚Äë687‚Äë8300

¬∑        There are a bunch of emergency boxes around campus. They all vary in their appearance, but all have a blue light and a speaker system. Should there be an emergency and you're away from your phone, use those. [See blue light emergency phones](https://admissions.uncc.edu/parents/safety-and-security).

¬∑        Additionally, the school offers free access to an app called LiveSafe. It has certain features which allow you to share your location with another person and they can watch you walk your route and if necessary, contact the campus police. You can also text campus police from the app. [Link](https://emergency.uncc.edu/communications/communications/livesafe)

Parking and Transportation

¬∑        Parking during the Fall/Spring semester is very different from summer sessions. The parking lots are often very crowded/full after 9-10am. [Use this link to access parking availability across all decks](https://parkingavailability.uncc.edu/). There is almost always parking in North Deck, it is just a farther walk from most classes.

¬∑        They can and will ticket your car if you park on campus without a pass or you park in an area you‚Äôre not supposed to.

¬∑        The campus bus system is free to use for all students and guests. The bus system app, [NextRide](https://pats.uncc.edu/transportation/nextride-bus-tracker) tracks all active buses in real time and gives an estimation of when it should arrive at each stop.

¬∑        As a student you can ride the CATS lightrail and CATS bus system for free [Link](https://lightrail.uncc.edu/using-light-rail), you just have to show your student ID card. Some people have reported parking at the light rail stop at JW Clay Blvd and riding in the light rail to campus. I don‚Äôt know how this works, just that some people do so.

¬∑        Parking around campus (i.e. at a nearby business like Food Lion) is risky. There are cases of cars getting towed.

¬∑        Have a guest coming over for the weekend? ‚ÄúElsewhere, permits are currently not enforced between 10 p.m. Friday and 5 a.m. Monday with the exception of football home-game weekends; then, all vehicles must have a valid UNCC permit or display a valid game day event permit‚Äù [Link](https://pats.uncc.edu/faqs/permits/are-permits-required-weekends)

¬∑        The e-share scooters and bikes on campus require payment through the [Gotcha app](https://pats.uncc.edu/transportation/e-scooters-and-bikes).

Food/Drink

¬∑        Every building has a vending machine somewhere. They are usually close to the ground or first floor. Bottle fillers (not water fountains) are usually found near the vending machines.

¬∑        [NinerDiners](https://aux.uncc.edu/dining/mobile-ordering) allows you to order ahead at a majority of the restaurants on campus.

¬∑        Dining Maps, hours and menus can be found [here](https://aux.uncc.edu/dining/dining-map)

¬∑        Food insecure? The [Jamil Niner Student Pantry](https://ninerpantry.uncc.edu/) allows all students to request food items

¬∑        Have a ton of swipes left over at the end of term? You can donate swipes to other students [Link](https://ninerpantry.uncc.edu/resources/meal-swipes-program).

Textbooks

¬∑        My recommendation, do NOT buy classes before the first class. Some classes you can get by without the textbook, some professors are cool with previous editions. If the textbook is for a class not within your major or not interesting. You can rent textbooks from the campus bookstore or even Amazon which are a lot cheaper.

¬∑        There are alternate tips to download books which some students find helpful [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/l3gy0j/here_is_a_link_for_a_free_pdf_of_nearly_any/)

Technology

¬∑        Printing is included with tuition for CCI and engineering students (maybe other majors?) but most students have to pay for printing which requires funds in your 49er Account [Link](https://aux.uncc.edu/copy-print/copy-and-print-services)

¬∑        Forgot your calculator/laptop/charger at home? You can rent some devices through the library [Link](https://library.uncc.edu/technology-equipment/borrow-technology)

¬∑        Some software is freely or discounted to students such as Office 365 ProPlus, SPSS, EndNote, and ChemDraw Professional. You can find and download a list of software [here](https://uncc.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx)

Mental Health/Student Wellness

¬∑        The Center for Counseling at Psychological Services (CAPS) offers free mental health services and/or groups. [Link](https://caps.uncc.edu/)

¬∑        If you‚Äôre living on campus, the [Student Health Center](https://studenthealth.uncc.edu/) has a pharmacy, immunizations, as well as over the counter medications.

¬∑        The Student Health Center sometimes runs free STD testing and pre-COVID had a cornucopia of barrier protections such as condoms, dental dams, and I swear I once saw [finger condoms](https://www.healthline.com/health/finger-condom).

Disability Services

¬∑        If you have mobility issues whether permanent or temporary (lower limb injuries/recent surgery), you can also request access to [ParaTransit](https://pats.uncc.edu/transportation/disability-paratransit)

¬∑        If you believe you require am accommodation, it almost always has to go through the [Office of Disability Services](https://ds.uncc.edu/). This includes accommodations for mental and emotional reasons. I highly encourage anyone who needs accommodations to reach out to them even if you do not need accommodations all the time due to an intermittent condition. The office of disability will privately and confidentially contact your professors every semester and let them know what accommodations you may need, but your professors will never see your medical records or even told why the accommodation is necessary.

Class Tips/Tutoring

¬∑        COVID has allowed for use to go back and often listen to recordings, but in-person this option may no longer be available. Ask your professor if they would be comfortable with you recording audio through your phone. Asking is a formality and most teachers I‚Äôve had are okay with it and they will usually allow you to place your phone next to them/at the podium before class and you can collect your phone after class is dismissed.

¬∑        Make at least one (studious) friend in each of your classes and exchange contact info. You never know if you‚Äôll be sick, late, in quarantine and can‚Äôt make it to class. If you have at least one friend in each class you can always reach out and get some notes.

New to College?

¬∑        Your previous teachers may have used the line, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going easy on you, your college professors are going to expect you to‚Ä¶dress more professionally/be more formal/etc.‚Äù Largely you‚Äôll find while you should always be respectful and polite, some college professors and TA‚Äôs are not as scary as they were made out to be. Please email or reach out if you‚Äôre struggling through email or stop by during office hours. Your professors are human too and understand the transition from high school (or even adult transitioning back to college) can be a rough one.

¬∑        Unless a professor demands it, you don‚Äôt need to raise your hand to go to the bathroom or get water. Just as quietly as possible, get up and go.",UNCCharlotte,"I made this for any student who is new to campus or transferring in to UNCC as a general guide on various topics which I see come up frequently here.

EveninqSkies,"I'll likely have to have two surgeries over the upcoming semester, both unrelated, but I'll need to be under anesthesia for both. I should be back in school as possible after each surgery, and likely will try to schedule one of them on October 11th so that I can avoid having to miss too much school (and it's not in the Charlotte area so I don't have to worry about that date in particular being booked by college students also not trying to miss school), but I'm still worried. 

One of them in particular will likely be rough because it's usually done in kids and hits adults harder. I did have it done as a childhood but the doctor warned me I would need it again when I hit adulthood. And it's starting to impact my day-to-day life so I need to get that surgery as soon as possible both for my health and my academics. I'm seeing it could take up to a week to recover enough to go to school or work. Which isn't good because I can't really go any earlier than my body allows, it's eye surgery, so if I can't see well then it'll be really difficult to function in a school environment. 

The other surgery is removing a wisdom tooth so that won't be too bad at all, should be fine to just get the surgery on a Friday and go back on Monday if there aren't any complications.

As promised, if you want to connect and discuss the [latest post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/ouek1r/covid19_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I made regarding COVID-19 and how it potentially affects our fall, you can feel free to drop in on my virtual office hours using [this link.](https://uncc.zoom.us/j/91998130076?pwd=Y2dmSGhYclV0ZUtxaXJUSmIxSy90QT09) I'll be on till 11:00 am.",UNCCharlotte,SGA Office Hours,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/ouie7r/sga_office_hours/,ouie7r,8,2,"07/30/2021, 06:58:19"
WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I wanted to come on here and provide an in depth update with everything I know regarding the Delta variant and how it potentially affects our fall semester. My apologies as this will be a lengthy post, however the seriousness of the situation makes it feel appropriate. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The information-** Currently, our vaccination rate for students sits at 43%. This aligns closely with the statewide average of 43.6% but trails the nationwide average of 49.8%. As of last Friday Mecklenburg County is experiencing a positivity rate of 8.4%. This is a sharp increase from 5.2% the Friday before. New numbers will be released today, but the expectation is they will only continue to increase. To put these rates into context, we were at roughly 7% when we went online last fall. It should be noted that with a 43% vaccination rate, that buys us more grace than 7% this time last year did because the vaccine does make it harder (not impossible, simply harder) to spread. We have seen Delta spikes in both India and the UK. These spikes lasted on average 2 months (8-9 weeks) from start to finish, and were exponential in nature, meaning they took awhile to pick up steam, spiked rapidly, and died down in a similarly fast fashion. The US is currently in week 6 of this Delta spike according to officials monitoring the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**The ""good"" news-** ""Good"" is used loosely, because in this situation perhaps a more apt term to use is ""less bad"". The projected timeline for this spike, assuming it follows similar patterns seen in India and the UK, puts this ending either right before or the week of FDOC. Not ideal of course, but better than being dragged out throughout the semester. This has bought us enough time to try to slow the spread before starting the academic year. There's no guarantees, but with a return to indoor mask wearing and continued vaccination, the hope is we can stick to a timeline similar to that of others who have experienced this spike. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The bad news-** Nothing is essentially off the table at this point. With the vaccine being rolled out months ago, the expectation was that it would finally allow for us to emerge from this pandemic. Stalled vaccination rates continues to threaten our return to normal. I want to once again reiterate to everyone to **get the vaccine.** Once you get it, **let the school know** using [this link.](https://ninernationcares.uncc.edu/updated-faqs-fall-semester) Once you click on the link, simply click on the blue box in the top left corner and follow the instructions to upload your documentation. With vaccination rates sitting only at 43%, right now I don't have much of a leg to stand on when arguing for a normal semester. Everyone, including administration, wants as normal of a semester as possible. However, if need be, we have seen before that the school will defer to the recommendations of health officials. If we do our part, if we **get the vaccine** and can increase our vaccination rate, we can significantly increase our chances of having a normal semester. If we don't do our part, if the vaccination rate remains low while the positivity rate continues to climb, we run the risk of losing everything from no masks (as seen by today's announcement) to sporting events, to tailgates, to parties, to as far as an in person semester. Nothing is off the table. Help me protect our semester by giving me a leg to stand on. We need to increase that vaccination number so a legitimate case can be made to safely attempt a normal semester.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came down to Florida for vacation last Saturday, I didn't anticipate turning around just 3 days later and driving 10 hours one way so that I could sit through a day and a half of meetings about Delta. Unfortunately, as we all know and as I'm continually reminded, in this pandemic plans change quickly. I am doing everything I can to fight for a normal fall, but without a collective push to increase the vaccination rate, we risk everything we want to return to. If you haven't already, please **get the vaccine**. While it is ultimately your choice, before deciding not to **get the vaccine**, I would ask you to sincerely do genuine research on the science behind the vaccine and reflect on what all we have to lose if this situation only continues to worsen. If you have received the vaccine, good. Let the school know. This is the easiest and quickest way for us to boost that number in the short term. If you have already let the school know, even better. Talk to your circle and encourage them to **get the vaccine**.

&amp;#x200B;

Individuals who do not have the vaccine will be expected to comply with a number of precautionary measures, including, but not limited to, continuous testing. It has been made perfectly clear to me that these measures will not be optional, and that failure to comply will result in consequences. The most basic of which will likely be a lock out of Niner Net credentials, but I would not be surprised to see this list of consequences expanded. Individuals who are vaccinated will be largely exempt from these precautionary measures. So, I'll say it again, **get the vaccine**.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in time, I do not anticipate the school pulling the plug on an in person semester. I will give the disclaimer that this has not been conveyed to me in any official capacity. It is simply my best analysis of the situation, the information provided, and my read of the conversations I have been engaged in. **This is not guaranteed by any means.** I have little doubt that if more drastic measures are deemed necessary to fight this spike, they will be not only strongly considered, but very possibly utilized. We are past the point where a normal semester is a sure thing. Let's get back to that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize this is a controversial topic for many people. I want to be clear that my intention is not to cause controversy. My intention is to preserve a safe and normal fall semester. The vaccine allows us to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to wrap this up by thanking everyone for their patience, as I know many of you have been awaiting more information regarding this topic. As mentioned above, I had to abandon my family 3 days into vacation to return to Charlotte so that I could engage in conversations about this topic face to face. It was important to me that for a topic of this magnitude that I be there in person to work through this situation. Throughout this pandemic, it has reminded me it is equally important that I spend time with my loved ones, as we have all been reminded in some way, shape, or form just how fragile life can be. To that end, I apologize for any anxiety or stress that my ten hour drive back down to Florida may have caused, and greatly appreciate the grace and understanding that has been shown. More information will continue to come from both myself, the school, and others on this topic (I have another 10 hour drive back to Charlotte in my future this upcoming Monday to once again continue addressing this situation). As best I can, as quickly as I can, as accurately as I can, I will continue to do everything within my power to keep you updated and to look out for our collective best interests. To that end, I will be hosting two sessions of office hours. The first will be immediately after I hit post on this. You can join using [this link.](https://uncc.zoom.us/j/99257934358?pwd=SkdDVnF1amVjbWNxTXNWaDkvakx1Zz09) I will be on until 3 am to answer any and all questions you may have, as well as just talk through this all with you. The next session will run from 7 am-11 am tomorrow morning, and I will post that link separately at 7 am tomorrow. At 11 I will have to leave to discuss this situation with a member of the Board of Governors, followed by a series of meetings with officials from the System Offices. Throughout next week I will also be publicizing additional hours. Feel free to come on through, and let me here all of your thoughts.

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I wanted to provide some updates with things going on around SGA and the University. I know I promised an in-depth update regarding Delta and how it potentially impacts university operations, and I promise you it is still on its way. In addition to meetings with the Safety and Security department today, I also have meetings set up with both our Emergency Management Director Chris Gonyar and Chancellor Gaber tomorrow, so the in depth post will be coming tomorrow evening following those meetings. As much as I hate delaying the in depth post another day, I felt waiting until after talking to Chris and Chancellor Gaber was the most prudent decision in order to provide the most accurate picture and best be able to address any questions or concerns you may have. For now I wanted to give a brief overview of other topics so tomorrows post could be focused directly on Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fall 2021 Reopening Plans-** This is the brief version. As of this email, the University continues to plan with a relatively normal fall semester. It is important for us to remember however that we are not quite out of this pandemic yet. Concerns surrounding the Delta variant threaten our shared efforts to return to normal. To that end, **I strongly encourage all students who have not yet done so to get the safe and widely available COVID-19 vaccine. Receiving this vaccine is the best way we as students can do our part to ensure a normal and fun school year**. Once you receive the vaccine, be sure to let the school know by completing the [COVID-19 Vaccine Reporting Form](https://ninernationcares.uncc.edu/updated-faqs-fall-semester) by clicking on the blue box in the top left corner. As mentioned above, I will give a more in depth update regarding this topic tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

**What‚Äôs In Store For Sophomores-** Sophomore Class President Leo Cruz Cruz and the Sophomore Class Council will be hosting a series of Zoom calls every Wednesday at 6:00 pm from July 28th to August 18th. This is a great opportunity for rising Sophomores to learn more about how to get plugged in with the university and the city of Charlotte. You can hop on using [this link](https://uncc.zoom.us/s/96801018663). We hope to see you out here as we get ready for another school year!

&amp;#x200B;

**Fall Elections-** Student Government will be holding fall elections for a variety of Senate positions and Freshman Class President this fall. There are opportunities for all students to get involved regardless of class standing or previous Student Government experience. While more information will be coming out later, I wanted to share with you this interest form. If you are passionate about students, want to make a difference around campus, and are looking for leadership opportunities, we would love to have you in our organization. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the Attorney General Abigail Warren at [awarre48@uncc.edu](mailto:awarre48@uncc.edu). She will be overseeing elections and would be more than happy to help you as much as she can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Opportunities-** I also wanted to share some additional opportunities for students to get involved with Student Government. We have a number of initiatives we want to see accomplished, but we can‚Äôt do it alone. Opportunities currently exist to serve on the Senior Class Council, and applications can be found [using this link.](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/submitter/form/start/482592) Additionally, we are currently accepting applications to serve on the Police and Public Safety Student Advisory Board. This is a great opportunity to engage in shared governance regarding safety procedures and practices on our campus and I would encourage you to consider applying [here.](https://ninerengage.uncc.edu/submitter/form/start/469798)

I appreciate your patience as I continue to meet with University administrators and work through the threat posed by Delta. I am doing everything I can to advocate for a normal fall experience, and the best way you can help with that is by getting the vaccine. If you've already got it, great. Let the school know. If you've already let the school know, even better. Talk to your circle about getting the vaccine.

So basically for the school year and then you'd have the ability to renew the lease under your name if you'd like. It's a 1 bed/1 ba apartment off Sam Wilson blvd. (exit 29 on 85) so about a 20-minute commute to campus. If you work at Amazon CLT 2 its literally 5 minutes around the corner. It's a downstairs unit in a multi family home so lots of privacy with a nice shaded deck in the back. DM if you'd like to set up a time to come see the apartment or if you have any additional questions!

I'm not doing a credit check but you will have to show proof of income! 

Rent- 1130/mo with utilities included (water, heat, trash &amp; wi-fi)

F0cus_1,"Hello everyone, 

I‚Äôm currently finishing up an Associate in Science at my local community college. I should graduate in Spring 2022 with about 70 credits(lots of credits from when I was an early college student) and about a 3.3 or 3.4 gpa. My ACT  is a 24 and I have yet to take my SAT. My goal is to transfer into a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering. Looking at the curriculum, I should knock out about 2.5 -3 semesters of school at UNC. The only problem is the highest math I will graduate with is Mat172 or precalculus Trigonometry, meaning I will have to start Calc 1 at Charlotte. Please let me know if I have a good chance of getting accepted and about how many semesters it will take me to finish up the degree.

I would also appreciate any advice regarding internships related to a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree, such as where I should look, and if they‚Äôre easy to find either during the spring and fall semesters or the summer semester.

Long story short...: I went through a WHOLE lot of trauma in this room, I ended up developing clinical depression and an anxiety disorder along with PTSD due to the COVID lockdowns and a bunch of family issues at home, it got to the point where I couldn't take care of my basic necessities, any and everything that reminds me of those times just brings back so many bad memories, emotions, all types of bad feelings, etc. I had to do a medical withdrawal from the university for a while to seek medical help. Good news is that I was able to comeback the next semester and complete the semester successfully. Bad news is that I've been assigned to the same exact room I went through all that stuff in and I'm not 100% recovered yet. I'm still taking an SSRI(antidepressant) and still in the recovery process. Just thinking about that room brings back so many bad memories and triggers my anxiety so much, and I haven't even moved in yet. I can only imagine what it'll be like if I actually had to move back into there. To give some more context: there were a lot of issues at home and I had just moved back on campus from being in complete isolation for what felt like years. I do not want anything to do with that room or anything that reminds me of those horrible times. And of course, with my luck I got assigned to the same exact room out of every possible preference that I picked in Levine. If anyone could please help me out it would be one of the biggest acts of generosity and I will forever be grateful to you.

It's pretty long, but hopefully I didn‚Äôt miss anything :)

**Vaccines**

* There will be opportunities to be vaccinated on campus again through clinics in August, they're looking at the 19th and 25th right now
* 71% of faculty and staff have submitted vaccination proof
* 35% of students have submitted vaccination proof (vaccinations became available to our age group later, so predictive modeling believes 50% are vaccinated)
* These numbers are only those who have submitted proof and are fully vaccinated, including the full 2 weeks, so they think even more people have been vaccinated and just not attested (you can do so here - [https://ninernationcares.uncc.edu/health-safety/covid-19-vaccine-information/covid-19-vaccine-reporting-form?j=787695&amp;sfmc\_sub=125527152&amp;l=296\_HTML&amp;u=16970213&amp;mid=515006741&amp;jb=4006](https://ninernationcares.uncc.edu/health-safety/covid-19-vaccine-information/covid-19-vaccine-reporting-form?j=787695&amp;sfmc_sub=125527152&amp;l=296_HTML&amp;u=16970213&amp;mid=515006741&amp;jb=4006))
* If you are vaccinated, you will not have to quarantine if you‚Äôre identified through contact tracking and will not have to participate in surge (wastewater) testing, surveillance (random) testing, or complete Niner Health Check

**Masks**

* If you are not vaccinated, you are required to wear masks in all situations
* If you are vaccinated, you are not required to wear masks except in a few situations where physical distancing isn‚Äôt always possible or the state/CDC mandates it: classrooms and instructional areas, Niner Transit, and Student Health Center (may include other large events or gatherings as well)

**HRL**

* Move-in will be between August 18th-21st by appointment, emails will be sent out this Friday to sign up for a time slot
* Students will not be assigned roommates based on vaccination status
* Quarantine space is available for those who need to stay on-campus while being quarantined in Maple Hall and Greek Village
* If you are vaccinated, you will not need to wear a mask in the residence halls
* Roommate agreements will allow you set safety guidelines that you and your roommate(s) feel comfortable with
* If you would like to change your housing assignment, call early as options close up fast and they are expecting full capacity

**Classes**

* We can expect full capacity in classrooms, masks will be required regardless of vaccination status
* There should be no more changes in instructional method (online vs. in-person) except in rare situations
* There are still a bit of online classes and a few will always be offered even after COVID, but there won‚Äôt be as many in the spring

**Student Life**

* Campus is expecting a full welcome back with plenty of events: UREC, Greek life, student organizations, and more will be available to participate in
* Niner Destination mobile app hosts all information for Gold Rush and other events as we return ([http://unc-charlotte.imodules.com/s/1721/m19/interior.aspx?sid=1721&amp;gid=24&amp;pgid=1665](http://unc-charlotte.imodules.com/s/1721/m19/interior.aspx?sid=1721&amp;gid=24&amp;pgid=1665))
* Athletics will have spectators this year and tailgates will be back
* There will be special events for the sophomore class, like freshman usually have and both classes will be invited to the New Student Convocation the Sunday before FDOC

**Aux**

* Dining will be back with expanded to-go options
* Distancing will not be mandated in dining spaces, but there will be areas in Sovi, Crown, and Prospector for students who prefer physical distancing
* Dining hours will be similar to fall 2019 with a few changes
* More locations will become cashless to eliminate as much contact as possible, but there will be transaction machines to put cash on your student ID
* Parking permits will go on sale on August 2nd
* The first e-bill for tuition, fees, housing, dining, etc. will be posted to accounts tomorrow (July 14th)",UNCCharlotte,Return to Campus Town Hall Recap,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/ojndvw/return_to_campus_town_hall_recap/,ojndvw,2,1,"07/13/2021, 15:48:57"

quicknaps,"Hey guys, I'm kinda frustrated and couldn't think of a better place to vent about this. My brother is going into his senior year at UNCC and signed up to stay in the dorms just as he has every year. Each year he was able to get a bedroom to himself. This year, he was assigned to share a room with a random person despite not putting that on his list of 8 housing preferences. He signed up before the priority deadline. Despite being recently assigned his room, the deadline to cancel housing was June 2nd. We will have to pay a $750 liquidation fee to cancel and so far they have not been at all understanding despite us trying to explain the situation.

intergaycial,"There is a lot of construction happening on campus right now. Quite a few trees are being torn down along the Greenway beside the track field, tennis courts and alumni pavilion. A large path all the way down the Greenway has also been completely cleared out. I understand the mission here is to mitigate the flooding issue (and upgrade the sewage system). 

What I don't understand is where all these animals were supposed to go that lived in and around the trees. Last year I had one hawk living close to my apartment and I would see them every week or so. I now have at least 3 hawks, and there are multiple living along Mary Alexander Road, including in the trees at the botanical gardens. 

I feel for them. I hope they can survive. I'm sure they don't have enough food here. 

Does anyone know how Charlotte's Canopy City rules work? The trees there were so dense, and full of life. I remember walking the Greenway North of campus during COVID last year and I occasionally saw an owl. We built a relationship, and his tree was torn down about 6 months ago. Haven't seen him since.

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I have received enough of the HEERF III updates to where I wanted to come on here and share them with y'all. I want to note that this is still a fluid situation, and while I think it's unlikely that the information provided will significantly change, I do have to give the disclaimer that nothing seems set in stone with this round of funding. Having said that, here's what I know.

&amp;#x200B;

**HEERF III July Timeline**\- In early July, distance ed students will receive funds in order to cover the difference in tuition increases in the fall (you'll recall that under the summer model of classes, students receive a discounted rate compared to the fall, when students pay the full amount with all associated fees). By mid-July UTOP students with exceptional need will be receiving funds. As a program that begins in July, this is why UTOP students are receiving funds before students enrolled in fall but not summer classes. Moving on to the general population, block awards will be issued to enrolled students who can demonstrate exceptional need (ie FAFSA but there are other ways I will discuss later on). Starting with Pell recipients, the school hopes to reach students between 100% to 200% of the [Federal Poverty Guidelines](https://aspe.hhs.gov/2021-poverty-guidelines). There is stull budget analysis being conducted to determine where exactly the cutoff will be. There are obviously a number of variables that go into this, such as amount given, how much is kept in reserve for emergency applications, what percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines the school hits, etc. Because of that, I do not have a clear answer as to how much the average student can expect to receive in a typical award. I have reached out for guidance and will provide it when I have it. **Barring any unforeseen issues**, students who fall in the Distance Ed, UTOP, and regular block (enrolled in fall, not summer classes) will receive the funds no later than **July 15th**. Having said  that, please keep in mind that we have experienced a number of issues with this distribution, and still struggle with other issues that will be outlined below.

&amp;#x200B;

**HEERF III August Timeline**\- In August, students in the [Forty-Niner Intensive Transition (FIT) Program](https://utop.uncc.edu/what-utop/fit-forty-niner-transition-program) may possibly receiving funds. Block awards will also be issued to international students who can demonstrate aid. Unfortunately, international students cannot fill out the FAFSA, so there will be other means of determining eligibility for international students.

&amp;#x200B;

**HEERF III Emergency Application**\- For those of you who need immediate need now, there is a link for an emergency application that is being worked out right now (for context, there were three links developed, all three had issues, once IT figures out the issues with the link, the application will be live). It should be noted that if you receive emergency funds right away, this will affect later block awards. For example, if I would normally receive $1,000 but I apply for $500 emergency funding, later on, when I would receive $1,000, I would receive only the other $500. Since eligible students will be receiving funds (again, barring any unforeseen circumstances) no later than July 15th, the suggestion is to first wait, see if you get the aid in mid-July, and if not then fill out the application. This is to mitigate any confusion or issues in case a student inadvertently received both emergency funding and a block award. As outlined above, in an ideal scenario all the number line up, but with the raw amount of students and funds, it adds to the complication of the scenario so an ""ideal"" scenario is unlikely. As soon as I receive the updated link, I will share that here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Emergency Reserves**\- the school is hoping to distribute half of the funds in the Fall, and reserve the other half for the Spring. The intention is to do another, similar round of distribution in the Spring. Personally, I am more so of the opinion of putting more funds on the front end. Having said that, once the issues with the emergency aid application are worked out, this will provide recourse for students who may run into issues who cannot wait until the Spring for additional funding. The reasoning for this approach is that this is near certainly the last package of federal aid, and as such it's better to be prudent than to burn through the funds, leaving little recourse for unforeseen events that may play out as an ongoing result of the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that this update is not all encompassing. I'm still waiting on more clear and concise answers surrounding award amounts, the emergency application, and more. However, I felt it important to come on here with the information I have while I continue to work on getting the information I don't. I have to give a huge shoutout to Bruce Blackmon, the University's Director of Financial Aid, and his team for the tireless work they've put into this project. They have provided every answer to every question I have asked, and for the questions they have not been able to answer, they have diligently worked to get me an answer as quickly as possible. They've heard out my feedback and input, and the level of care they have displayed for students in need has been nearly unprecedented from my time in Student Government. As updates continue to come in, I will continue to do my part to keep y'all updated. I am still waiting on word for when the University will be formally communicating this information with y'all, but for those of you dealing with a difficult situation, I hope this update can serve as a source of reassurance for you in these difficult times. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to comment below, and I will do my best to answer your questions.

Since UNCC was taking so long on the repeal, I decided to just go to a private loan place because the main reason I need more money is because I lost my job of 5 years last year and I need to be able to pay rent/bills while I‚Äôm full time (5 classes this fall.)

Just to salt my wound, they decreased my private loan (that I was 100% approved for) from 14k to 3.5k. 

I don‚Äôt have help from family. I‚Äôm an older student and I‚Äôve put my education on hold for many years and struggled working full time and school part time. 

I had planned to get an internship next Summer that would *hopefully* help me pay for my remaining time at UNCC.

The app consistently told my friends and I that we were parking the bikes and scooters in restricted areas - even though we parked them in the marked squares. I decided to switch bikes halfway through because the battery was dying and the new bike‚Äôs brake system was broken so it wouldn‚Äôt move. I immediately ended the ride and parked it right where it was (I literally didn‚Äôt move it) and I still got a $5 parking penalty. 

Combined, my 3 friends and I, ended up with $30+ in unnecessary fines. Not to mention that at every station, the majority of bikes/scooters were offline. We had to traverse across campus to find working options. Besides the bike with the broken brakes- some of the scooters and bikes that would let us check them out would literally be locked up or dead for no reason so we would have to end the rides (you get charged $1.50 every time you unlock a new bike and a $5 credit card hold as well). 

If this was during the summer with like no one on campus, I can‚Äôt imagine what it will be like during the fall/spring semesters. 10/10 never trying that again. It‚Äôs honestly so disappointing because they are really fun.

These can be things the University is currently doing that you want to see continued. These can be things the University is doing that you want to see changed. These can be things the University is not doing that you want to see them start. The floor is truly yours, and I am truly listening. I can't promise that everything will be accomplished over the course of the next year, but I can promise that Student Government is committed to doing what we can to enhance your student experience and serve as your voice.

JeffJacksonNC,"I honestly didn't think this bill had much of a chance, but it might actually be moving.

(Here's a [link](https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2021/Bills/Senate/PDF/S711v1.pdf) to the full bill.)

This Judiciary committee meeting is the farthest this kind of legislation has ever gone in our state legislature.

There was lots of skepticism from GOP members, but also genuine openness.

The bill's sponsors went to great lengths to discuss how this bill is designed for medical cannabis only, which was clearly an attempt to assuage concerns from members of the majority party.

The bill isn‚Äôt based on the approach of any other state - it‚Äôs a more tightly regulated than you see in other medical cannabis states.

We‚Äôre heard personal testimony about cancer, debilitating diseases, and PTSD specifically in veterans.

One comment: ‚ÄúIt may not let you live another day, but it can make today a little better.‚Äù

We also heard from former Marines about how medical cannabis can be preferable to the ‚Äúcombat cocktail‚Äù of prescription medicine that the VA often uses for PTSD. Really powerful testimony from them about suicide prevention.

The bill is set to go through four committees. That‚Äôs as many as I‚Äôve ever seen a bill assigned to. That means this is being handled with extreme caution by the majority. It wasn't up for a vote in our committee today - ""discussion only."" Passage is by no means a foregone conclusion.

That's the latest. I'll keep you posted.

zane910,"Hello everyone.  I've been seeing alot of posts from people and it seems alot of them are new students  and/or freshmen asking for advice as new students to college or UNCC itself.  As a recent graduate who's been to the school long enough, I'd figure I'd make a post providing some advice and where others can provide insights to those who ask.

* LC's are useful if you're willing to put out the money for them.  You'll be surrounded with people in the same or similar majors and it's easy to form study groups or get help.  Some LC's even have classrooms in the building for required courses, so attending classes hardly takes more than a few minutes.
* Meal plans are required if you're living on campus.  Those not living in the dorms can still opt for meal plan still.  If you prefer not spending too much on required meal plans, look into the cheapest options available rather than sticking with what's shown to you during orientation.
* Food courts on campus are decent enough with the newer one near the freshman dorms in the front of campus offering nicer meals.  They are a step up from anything you'd have had in public school and can sneak in a container to save meals for later.
* Parking is free after \~9:30 PM Friday - 6:00 AM Monday.  You can park in the Union guest deck overnight on Thursdays and leave Friday night or later without paying if you're willing to wait for the gates to open.  Just be sure to check if there is a game or major event happening on campus that weekend as the university may put a ticket on you during home games weeks for staying past a certain time on Friday.
* The school requires students to have insurance if you're AT LEAST part time (6 credit hours undergrad). They will automatically charge you \~$1400 for a SINGLE semester EACH semester unless you let them know you have your own or get your own.  If you'd prefer not paying such an exorbitant amount and have no reason to believe you'd need such insurance, look into your own.  Cheapest ones cost \~$50 a month. $250 per semester.  Remember, you're getting what you pay for.  Be sure to have the insurance before the semester begins at least.
* Classrooms are generally open and available to use on weekends and Friday evenings freely.  Be sure not to make a mess or damage anything and you should be fine.  Good for moving get-togethers to another location with screens and projectors.
* Be sure to look into work and internships by Junior year.  Job market is competitive and places are looking for experience most of all.  Work on gaining experience while in school where available for the job you want.
* I do recommend Community College first rather then going entirely into the University.  Classes are easier and far cheaper with the same lessons being done.  They equate to the first 2 years of University studies with providing an Associate's at the end you can use immediately for the last two.
* For NC residents, look up the Golden Leaf Scholarship.  Mainly for STEM degrees, but still might be open to others.

WeWantDick,"Hey Y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I first and foremost want to apologize. I've been overdue for a HEERF III update, but have been playing a not so fun game of having to track down a number of different people in order to share the most up to date, accurate information regarding an explanation for the HEERF III delays as well as provide information for what's being done to get you your aid. I apologize in advance for what is going to be a very long post, but it's the culmination of literally weeks of advocacy.

&amp;#x200B;

The most pressing question I have been receiving is *""what's taking so long?!""* If I'm being perfectly honest, its been the biggest question on my mind personally. Throughout this process, I have spoken to Vice Provosts, Budget Directors, Vice Chancellors, legal affairs, and more trying to get a straightforward, common sense explanation for what is taking HEERF III so much longer to distribute than HEERF I and II. In a nutshell, it boils down to a combination of bureaucracy and, quite frankly, too many cooks in the kitchen. First, some background information. It is important to keep in mind that HEERF I and II were developed under a different administration with a different Congress. The architects for those packages were different than the architects for HEERF III simply due to the timing of the legislation and the political dynamics at the time. HEERF I and HEERF II were relatively straightforward processes. As most of y'all are aware, the aid came in and it came out extremely quickly. What I found out during my research on this is that a number of changes in guidance occurred after the fact, but hey. Once the funds are distributed, theres not really anything that can be done, so it really didn't slow the machine down in terms of distributing funds.

&amp;#x200B;

HEERF III was developed under a new administration, with a new makeup in Congress. As such, right off the bat the plan was more difficult to understand, because one simply couldn't rely on the precedents set by HEERF I and II. To further complicate matters, it was made clear this was likely going to be the last round of funding. Between that and the sheer volume of the funding compared to HEERF I and II, a number of different entities started getting involved that previously hadn't. Those entities include the federal government, the state government, the UNC System Offices, the Board of Governors, and the school itself. This is what I mean when I say too many cooks in the kitchen, and let me now walk you through how it has resulted in the delays we have experienced up until this point. I will give the disclaimer that the scenario I am about to describe, while similar to the reality of the situation, is vastly oversimplified for explanation purposes, and as such more so meant to put things in perspective and not to be taken as an exact breakdown for what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

UNCC has to take time to understand the differences between HEERF I and II before distributing HEERF III. After doing so, they go ahead and develop Plan A. Before the plan can be finalized, the Federal government steps in and announces that international students are now eligible for HEERF III whereas they weren't for HEERF I and II (this actually happened). Now the University has to rework Plan A to include international students. Further complicating matters is the difficulty of determining which international students qualify as low income. Tools such as the FASFA are used for domestic students, not international students. So now the school finally figures all of that out and has Plan B. Just as funds are about to be released, the state steps in and issues guidance for how funds should be distributed, when, in what order, etc. Back to the drawing board to incorporate this guidance for Plan C. Before Plan C can be released, the System Offices releases its own guidance. So now we're working on Plan D. But wait! The guidance from the state contradicts guidance elsewhere. So now we have to consult with Legal Affairs, talk to everyone issuing guidance, and iron everything out. We're now on Plan E, meanwhile students still haven't received aid, and everyone is wondering what the hell is going on. In a vastly oversimplified nutshell, this is essentially how we got here today.

&amp;#x200B;

So what now? Are we doomed to develop plan after plan until new guidance stops coming out, meanwhile students are continuing to struggle? Theres good news and bad news, followed by more good news. ""Good"" being relative, as I realize that for many of you reading this, the delays in receiving funds has been anything but good. The first piece of good news is that enough moving pieces have settled to where the school feels confident that a comprehensive plan can be developed over the next week or two that will satisfy all of the cooks in the kitchen. Tweaks will likely still arise as they often do with anything of this scale, but nothing that should seriously derail the plans like the scenarios mentioned above. The bad news is that this final timeline means that between development, approval, and implantation of the plan, funds will not begin hitting student accounts for another month, starting with those currently enrolled in distance education classes, followed by UTOP, so on and so forth. I recognize for many of you, the reality of the situation is that you literally cannot afford to wait for a month+ to receive funds. To that end, any day now an application for emergency funding will be launched so that those with pressing needs can immediately apply for aid. This process will be relatively straightforward and simple, without significant hoops to jump through. All that is required is the demonstration of a need for aid. This can be done in the form of a personal statement, documentation from a landlord, bank statements, really whatever you feel best illustrates your need for immediate relief. This is one of the areas that SGA pushed for extensively in the meetings we were in, because we recognize that for many of you this aid is long overdue. As soon as the application is live, I will be coming back here to share it with y'all.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to thank y'all for your patience and support as this has been looked into. This hasn't been an easy process, and my days have been filled with meeting after meeting regarding HEERF III. I promise you that if there is a hell, it looks like a budget meeting where someone is droning on about government aid and endless bureaucracy. I hope this update has been helpful, and I hope it is able to at the very least alleviate some of the stress and anxiety surrounding this financial situation. This process has revealed a number of systematic issues within the University, mainly surrounding communication, that I am going to be following up on over the next few weeks, but for now, my focus continues to be on ensuring students like y'all receive your aid as quickly as possible. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to comment below. As best I can, I'll answer your questions and do additional research on the ones I do not know.

Russian language and topic courses are offered at UNCC in the fall. Take a chance to learn a new language and explore the Russian culture, while possibly earning a minor in Russian. All courses are taught in English.

You can start by taking an elementary level language course and see how interesting it can be to learn a new language. Maybe you will decide to continue and take all 6 semesters of language that we offer.  You also can take the 3 courses we offer on translation and receive a certificate in translation that can be a valuable asset for you in the future.

We also offer courses on Russian culture - Russian film, Russian literature, and Civilization. We teach these in English so you can learn about the culture without learning the language. You can decide to become a specialist on Russia and get a Russian minor or you can just take courses you find interesting and useful.

on any of the Instagram pages such as uncc25, uncc25connect, or the face book pages like UNCC Class of 2025 or UNCC admitted students, post what hall you were assigned and what style, and what style you‚Äôre wanting to move into.

My worry is I would hate to go through the process of applying and enrolling only to find, after a semester or two, that I don't like it. Which takes me to the Bachelor's. The classes would be easier and I could complete it in less than a year since I have so many of the pre reqs already done, but I don't want to waste my time if there are better ways to spend my time. A second Bachelor's seems almost redundant, for lack of a better word. 

The other facet would be trying to balance it with work. Since I've already graduated, I've already started working so I'm torn yet another way. Assuming I could make it work with employers (current and future), do I cut back work hours to part time and do school along side it or just stop working and bite the bullet?

What do y'all think? I would greatly appreciate any insight or opinions y'all may have, from first hand experience or otherwise.",UNCCharlotte,Bachelor's vs Master's,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/ngmivr/bachelors_vs_masters/,ngmivr,3,4,"05/19/2021, 21:02:56"
