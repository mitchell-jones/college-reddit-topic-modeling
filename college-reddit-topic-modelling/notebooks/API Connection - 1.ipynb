       " submission(author='CCI-Grab', created_utc=1652925032, id='ussgcr', selftext='Alright, this post has been a long time coming. I started my undergrad in Computer Science here in 2017 planning on doing the Masters in 5 years program. Here I am, 5 years later, with a Masters. \\n\\nFor clarity - my undergrad is CCI with a concentration in Software Engineering and my grad degree is in Information Technology with a concentration in Web Development. Additionally, 2017-2022 was a weird set of year. We had a horrible incident on campus that will forever change the school and it’s students. We also, like everyone else, dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these major events had an effect on my experience here and there is no way to know how my time at UNCC would have been different without them. \\n\\nWith that out of the way, here’s my experience. It’s a long one but I’ll have a TLDR at the bottom. Also feel free to ask question or add on your experience in the comments!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Experience**\\n\\nFreshman year was pretty great. The professors teaching the introduction to CS classes were fantastic. I’ve heard other students complain about Dr. Java (that’s the name of a software, not a nickname of a professor but that should totally be a thing too) and the ”turtle assignments” but I thought they were a wonderful way to introduce concepts. I later tutored for CS classes and think the simplicity helped many students. To be fair, I has CS experience from high school so maybe I just thought they were easy and that made things better. UNCC also has many career opportunities, I took advantage of a lot of them freshman year but nothing came of any. I do think, however, a couple of the habits helped me in the long run. The end of the year celebrations/events made me enjoy finals, it was exciting and some of my favorite memories at UNCC were during this time.\\n\\nSophomore year I got more into my concentration. Data Structures and Calculus are genuinely some of the most useful courses I’ve taken. I also lived on campus so participating in on campus events was pretty great. UNCC does not have the same lively campus NC State or UNCG has but it isn’t too bad with the light rail right there. The year was cut short, however, with the events of April 30th. I only bring this up because it was a significant part of my college experience. Out of respect, I won’t go into details but I will say I was not satisfied with how the school helped students thought it. I’m sure their heart was in the right place but I really wished they had done more to reach out.\\n\\nJunior and Senior year were mostly from home. This is also the time where I would get to mostly take classes in my area of study. Sadly I don’t feel like many of them taught me much. The majority of the professors I had either knew what they were doing but not how to teach or knew neither. There were certainly some that broke the mold but they were rare. In lock down I spend a lot of my free time learning the basics of web development, got an internship through my own person networks, and continued school as an interrupt to my actual learning. I also ran into trouble with my advisor giving me bad information, delaying my graduation. This meant I would get my undergrad in 4 and a half years and need to really put my nose to the grindstone to get my MS on time.\\n\\nLast year of college, the plus one off the “4+1,” I spent one semester doing nothing because the mistake my advisor made and one semester with an overloaded schedule. This past semester has been the most stressful course load I’ve had in college, I really with my advisor didn’t put me in that position. I had to get special permission to do 15 credit hours, when grad students were usually only aloud 12, and do a 0 credit hour capstone. The capstone was easy but it still added easily avoidable stress. The silver lining is that I now get to be done. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Reflection**\\n\\nUNCC promised me great things as a CCI student, telling me they were the biggest Computer Science department in both the Carolinas. While the department’s courses start off strong, they fall off very quickly. Sadly, not quick enough for you to switch schools. I had four classes that I would consider useful to my career and $30,000 worth of classes that taught me how to take a test. With that said, I did get the piece of paper with “Masters” on it in 5 years. That’s roughly what the school can offer. If your only goal is to get a Masters ASAP, it can do that. In fact, you could probably do it in 4 years if you wanted. However, if you want to become a computer scientist and be prepared for the workforce, you’re better off spending a summer on Codecademy. I’m only speaking for the Software Engineering / Web Development side of things but I personally feel that my degree is not worth the paper it’s printed on (well I suppose the ink is probably worth more than the paper but you get the idea). UNCC did not aid my learning, they hindered it. By filling up my life with busy work, they made it harder for me to pursue my academic interests. I still aspire to get a PhD but I feel severely unequipped for research in my field of study. Even as someone looking to get a job, I find my technical skills have only gotten rusty by going to this school. I’m not knocking anyone who just wants to get in and get out with a degree ASAP though. That‘s perfectly valid and UNCC is a great option for that. In my opinion, it is hard to fail the classes here if you put any amount of time into them. It’s a great school for getting your degree with as little friction as possible.\\n\\nI don’t mean to bash the school or the professors here. I’ve had some professors that I absolutely loved. Some professors are great at teaching, know their stuff, and genuinely care. Sadly, that is not the average professor. I also don’t want to speak outside of what I know. I’m sure other departments or even other concentrations in my department are better. Every single Writing and Math professor I’ve had, I absolutely adored. My minor for my undergrad was Bioinformatics and that department and it’s professors are fantastic. The people there made me strongly considering going into that field alone. In the Software Engineering and Web Development track, however, you have to get lucky to land many great professors. UNCC is a factory to pump out Computer Science graduates for the banks in Charlotte. My biggest regret in college is not trying harder to get into a different school.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;**TLDR**: UNCC has many wonderful aspects, some amazing professors, and a fun campus if you know what you’re looking for. However, they quality of the courses is (in my experience) questionable. If you want to learn software engineering, become a good developer, or further your career in academia, then UNCC is not for you. If you want to get degree and a decent well-paying job in computer science, UNCC can do that for you. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nJust some tips to new students to end this on a more positive note:\\n\\n* Always work on personal projects. This is where you learn and what employers want to see. If you dedicated 2 hours a week, (mostly) every week, to some projects, you’ll be ahead of the curb.\\n* Choose classes based on professor’s RateMyProfessor NOT based on timing. 8am’s suck, I know, but it’s worth the trade off. \\n* Keep an active LinkedIn. Add everyone you can. Post thanking speakers. It’s a really easy way yo get involved with the greater community without actually doing much. \\n* Go to clubs. They’re great, you’ll make friends.\\n* Use the library to get work done, change spaces is super useful for productivity and our library is awesome. \\n* Go to office hours. Always. Get in the habit of going just to review. Having that more person relationship with the professors and TA’s will make classes much less stressful.', subreddit='UNCCharlotte', title='My experience at UNCC', url='https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/ussgcr/my_experience_at_uncc/', created=1652939432.0, d_={'author': 'CCI-Grab', 'created_utc': 1652925032, 'id': 'ussgcr', 'selftext': 'Alright, this post has been a long time coming.

Both of these major events had an effect on my experience here and there is no way to know how my time at UNCC would have been different without them. \\n\\nWith that out of the way, here’s my experience. It’s a long one but I’ll have a TLDR at the bottom. Also feel free to ask question or add on your experience in the comments!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Experience**\\n\\nFreshman year was pretty great. The professors teaching the introduction to CS classes were fantastic. I’ve heard other students complain about Dr. Java (that’s the name of a software, not a nickname of a professor but that should totally be a thing too) and the ”turtle assignments” but I thought they were a wonderful way to introduce concepts. I later tutored for CS classes and think the simplicity helped many students. To be fair, I has CS experience from high school so maybe I just thought they were easy and that made things better. UNCC also has many career opportunities, I took advantage of a lot of them freshman year but nothing came of any. I do think, however, a couple of the habits helped me in the long run. The end of the year celebrations/events made me enjoy finals, it was exciting and some of my favorite memories at UNCC were during this time.\\n\\nSophomore year I got more into my concentration. Data Structures and Calculus are genuinely some of the most useful courses I’ve taken. I also lived on campus so participating in on campus events was pretty great. UNCC does not have the same lively campus NC State or UNCG has but it isn’t too bad with the light rail right there. The year was cut short, however, with the events of April 30th. I only bring this up because it was a significant part of my college experience. Out of respect, I won’t go into details but I will say I was not satisfied with how the school helped students thought it. I’m sure their heart was in the right place but I really wished they had done more to reach out.\\n\\nJunior and Senior year were mostly from home. This is also the time where I would get to mostly take classes in my area of study. Sadly I don’t feel like many of them taught me much. The majority of the professors I had either knew what they were doing but not how to teach or knew neither. There were certainly some that broke the mold but they were rare. In lock down I spend a lot of my free time learning the basics of web development, got an internship through my own person networks, and continued school as an interrupt to my actual learning. I also ran into trouble with my advisor giving me bad information, delaying my graduation. This meant I would get my undergrad in 4 and a half years and need to really put my nose to the grindstone to get my MS on time.\\n\\nLast year of college, the plus one off the “4+1,” I spent one semester doing nothing because the mistake my advisor made and one semester with an overloaded schedule. This past semester has been the most stressful course load I’ve had in college, I really with my advisor didn’t put me in that position. I had to get special permission to do 15 credit hours, when grad students were usually only aloud 12, and do a 0 credit hour capstone. The capstone was easy but it still added easily avoidable stress. The silver lining is that I now get to be done. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Reflection**\\n\\nUNCC promised me great things as a CCI student, telling me they were the biggest Computer Science department in both the Carolinas. While the department’s courses start off strong, they fall off very quickly. Sadly, not quick enough for you to switch schools. I had four classes that I would consider useful to my career and $30,000 worth of classes that taught me how to take a test. With that said, I did get the piece of paper with “Masters” on it in 5 years. That’s roughly what the school can offer. If your only goal is to get a Masters ASAP, it can do that. In fact, you could probably do it in 4 years if you wanted. However, if you want to become a computer scientist and be prepared for the workforce, you’re better off spending a summer on Codecademy. I’m only speaking for the Software Engineering / Web Development side of things but I personally feel that my degree is not worth the paper it’s printed on (well I suppose the ink is probably worth more than the paper but you get the idea). UNCC did not aid my learning, they hindered it. By filling up my life with busy work, they made it harder for me to pursue my academic interests. I still aspire to get a PhD but I feel severely unequipped for research in my field of study. Even as someone looking to get a job, I find my technical skills have only gotten rusty by going to this school. I’m not knocking anyone who just wants to get in and get out with a degree ASAP though. That‘s perfectly valid and UNCC is a great option for that. In my opinion, it is hard to fail the classes here if you put any amount of time into them. It’s a great school for getting your degree with as little friction as possible.\\n\\nI don’t mean to bash the school or the professors here. I’ve had some professors that I absolutely loved. Some professors are great at teaching, know their stuff, and genuinely care. Sadly, that is not the average professor. I also don’t want to speak outside of what I know. I’m sure other departments or even other concentrations in my department are better. Every single Writing and Math professor I’ve had, I absolutely adored. My minor for my undergrad was Bioinformatics and that department and it’s professors are fantastic. The people there made me strongly considering going into that field alone. In the Software Engineering and Web Development track, however, you have to get lucky to land many great professors. UNCC is a factory to pump out Computer Science graduates for the banks in Charlotte. My biggest regret in college is not trying harder to get into a different school.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;**TLDR**: UNCC has many wonderful aspects, some amazing professors, and a fun campus if you know what you’re looking for. However, they quality of the courses is (in my experience) questionable. If you want to learn software engineering, become a good developer, or further your career in academia, then UNCC is not for you. If you want to get degree and a decent well-paying job in computer science, UNCC can do that for you. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nJust some tips to new students to end this on a more positive note:\\n\\n* Always work on personal projects. This is where you learn and what employers want to see. If you dedicated 2 hours a week, (mostly) every week, to some projects, you’ll be ahead of the curb.\\n* Choose classes based on professor’s RateMyProfessor NOT based on timing. 8am’s suck, I know, but it’s worth the trade off. \\n* Keep an active LinkedIn. Add everyone you can. Post thanking speakers. It’s a really easy way yo get involved with the greater community without actually doing much. \\n* Go to clubs. They’re great, you’ll make friends.\\n* Use the library to get work done, change spaces is super useful for productivity and our library is awesome. \\n* Go to office hours. Always. Get in the habit of going just to review. Having that more person relationship with the professors and TA’s will make classes much less stressful.', 'subreddit': 'UNCCharlotte', 'title': 'My experience at UNCC', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/ussgcr/my_experience_at_uncc/', 'created': 1652939432.0}),\n",
