       " \"Transferring with weird grades from health issues. I am a compsci major in community college right now, I'd like to think I am decently smart, but my grades don't necessarily show that. basically it started my junior year of highschool, I was on a good track and I ended up going through some really bad stomach problems, I could've died, lost about 90 pounds and had to do school from home with a teacher that came  once a week. Because of this, several classes like german and english were failed just because the teacher I was assigned did not know how to do them from home and the grades from the rest of the classes weren't all to great either. I ended up coming back my senior year, I was doing good, until COVID hit, Everything went online, got laid off from my job, my mental health had really never been lower and because of that and me not being a great online learner, partially because of ADHD, I again suffered from awful grades. However I kept going and managed to graduate. Afterwords I enrolled in community and learned it was online again, same mental health spiral took place and i finished fall 2020 with a gpa under 1. I decided to take a year off, work on myself, get more self disciplined and come back, which I did. I came back this fall and managed to finish with a 4.0 GPA, I have my classes scheduled for this semester and summer and plan to transfer next fall, but because my less than admirable grade history I have no clue if my one semester of good grades and a promise will be any good anywhere much less UNC charlotte. If anyone has any advice I am all ears, also please pardon my bad grammar as I am exhausted.\",\n",

       " 'SGA Update 1/13- Return to In-Person Instruction Hey Y\\'all,\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor those of you who don\\'t know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. With a decision being made regarding omicron and the remainder of our semester, I wanted to come on here and provide some more information regarding the decision and our next steps moving forward.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs you know from today\\'s announcement, the school has decided to move forward with in-person instruction on the 24th. I want to emphasize that this decision was not made lightly. This decision was made only after careful consideration of the current COVID situation in the surrounding area as well as UNC Charlotte\\'s logistical capabilities and repeated conversations with public health officials and System Office personnel. Ultimately, it was decided that by the 24th we will be in a position where we can return to in-person instruction with a reasonable expectation that we can manage the omicron situation.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere are a few specific factors as it relates to this decision that I wanted to share with you. County health officials we\\'ve consulted with believe we hit our local peak as early as this week, with some even believing we hit it on January 10th (it should be noted that while the CDC considers the nationwide peak to be later this month, individual communities are going to have different time frames). While only four days ago, publicly available data seems supportive of this assessment. With still a week to further the distance between us and the peak, this is cause for optimism. Furthermore, the fact that January 24th is significantly removed from holiday travel further bolsters beliefs that we will be able to successfully avoid the brunt of this wave. It was decided to announce this decision now so that students had ample time prior to the add/drop deadline to make a well informed decision as to their class schedule as we move into this next phase.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere are additional measures the University is taking to help mitigate risk of spread over the next few weeks. The school has ordered 100,000 masks of a higher quality than the traditional masks that have been common throughout this pandemic. The quality of these masks are in line with an expected CDC announcement on updated guidance surrounding appropriate masks to mitigate the spread of omicron. These masks will be free for students and will be distributed during our return to campus. Furthermore, the school will be instituting restrictions on the size of events (30 people indoors, 50 outdoors) with the intention of cutting back on non-essential potential super spreader events until numbers further subside. While frustrating from a social perspective, this is an important step to allow us to avoid situations such as the current crisis at NC State, where massive outbreaks have resulted in zero available quarantine space for students. Additionally, ongoing mitigation testing, robust contact tracing, and wastewater testing will continue to allow us to quickly identify and contain potential outbreaks, perhaps more important than ever when considering the transmissibility of omicron.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI want to be clear, students will test positive. Outbreaks will occur, and we will likely see spikes. This is to be expected in a global pandemic. I say this not to alarm any members of the community, but rather prepare you for what we know to be the reality of the situation. This decision is not about the complete elimination of risk. This decision is about mitigating the risk in a manner where we feel confident we can properly handle and address any issues that arise throughout the semester. We are on the tail end of a wave, and we know waves do not last forever. With careful and proactive mitigation efforts, we can provide in-person instruction while providing the support and resources needed to confront this pandemic head on in a successful manner.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRegarding the remainder of the semester, while we have learned there are no absolutes in this pandemic, the intention is that we will remain in person throughout the remainder of the semester. The expectation is that barring the emergence of unforeseen strains we will return to \"normal.\" I have spoken with Chancellor Gaber regarding Spring Break, and have received assurances that it will remain unchanged, with the likely decision that we will incorporate some sort of reentry testing to proactively prevent bringing COVID back to the community. Graduation is also expected to remain an in-person event, and I know graduating seniors will appreciate hearing that. Of course, I need to emphasize that as we have seen throughout this pandemic, unforeseen situations develop, and without a crystal ball, there can be no guarantees. Having said that, assuming no new variants pop up, I find it difficult to imagine a scenario in which these plans are derailed.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThese are difficult decisions being made in difficult times, however I\\'m much more confident with us attempting an in-person start now than I would have been on January 10th. As we progress through these next few days and weeks, I will do my best to keep you all up to date with any new developments that may occur. Should you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to comment below and I will try my best to get to them as quickly as I can. As always, thank you for the continued privilege and honor of serving as your Student Body President, and Go Niners.',\n",

Everyone who has taken online classes at this point knows you are only getting about 50% of the value of what you would get if the class was in person since you cant make connections with professors, students, professors get lazy and classes overall are less engaging. I\\'ve had teachers come in the first day of class and just say \"this class is now online, if you dont want to do an online class switch classes\" like it is an option for everyone to just switch to a different teacher and time last minute. Teachers have been by in-large been much harder to contact since I never have the opportunity to see some of them in person and they don\\'t respond to emails in a reasonable amount of time. Teachers have even lowered the standards for what is acceptable and what it takes to pass the class drastically since I got here in 2019.

       " \"COVID-19 Omicron SGA Update Hey Y'all,\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Dick Beekman. I currently serve as the Student Body President within the Student Government Association. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that any opinions presented are mine alone, and that I do not speak on behalf of Student Government as a whole, all of the University, or the Board of Trustees. I wanted to come on here and provide an in depth update with everything I know regarding the Omicron variant and how it will be affecting our spring start. As recently as two days ago, I stated that to the best of my knowledge, no serious conversations surrounding us moving online due to Omicron had occurred. That was true then, however as we have seen, situations with COVID change often and they change rapidly. My apologies as this will be a lengthy post, however the seriousness of the situation makes it feel appropriate.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter consultation with public health officials and system office personnel, the decision has been made to begin our spring semester in an online capacity for the first two weeks. I cannot emphasize it enough, this is a decision that was not made lightly. Multiple circumstances led to this decision. The positivity rate in Mecklenburg County is currently at 15.4%, and is expected to continue to climb in the upcoming weeks. Not commented on in the Niner Notice are the significant logistical concerns that in my opinion represent the heart of the issue at hand. While early indications show that Omicron is less dangerous than Delta, we also know it spreads much more rapidly, resulting in a positive COVID test that necessitates a period of quarantine. For students that live on campus, this would mean the University is obligated to provide essential support services such as isolation housing, dining, sanitization of rooms and more. The University was already facing a significant labor shortage prior to the rise of omicron, and with the high positivity rate in the county, this only further complicates the situation if essential personnel are sidelined with COVID. This has the potential to create a nightmare scenario in which we have an overwhelming number of students who are required to quarantine without the necessary staff on hand to provide essential services. After examining all factors and current capabilities, the decision was made that it is in the best interest of the student body for us to begin online and reduce the chances of experiencing the scenario described above. With the projected peak currently slated for the end of January, the hope is that these two weeks will provide us enough breathing room to preserve the remainder of our semester.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI cannot emphasize it enough, it is my belief this decision ultimately boils down to current government regulations, labor issues faced by the school, and current capabilities to address a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. The University is obligated to abide by current government regulations which require an individual to quarantine for a certain number of days, regardless of whether they have omicron, delta, the original strand of the COVID-19 virus, or any other. They are required to quarantine regardless of the severity (or lack thereof) of an individual's symptoms. The University, as a public institution, **must** abide by these regulations. With the current government measures in place, the labor issues mentioned above, and the ability for Omicron to rapidly spread, a mass outbreak has the potential to overwhelm University resources. That is what this decision boils ultimately down to, more than anything else. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nYou likely have a number of questions about this decision and how it will affect the upcoming semester. While the Niner Notice contains the answer to most questions, I am still engaged in conversations with administrators in regards to more specific or individual questions about dining, housing, student life, academics, athletics, and more. As the dust settles, I'll be making a follow up post to address major questions. In the meantime, should you have any pressing questions, please feel free to comment them below, and I will do my best to either answer your question or track down the information you need.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI recognize this announcement will likely invoke strong feelings of frustration, disappointment, anger, and more. From the bottom of my heart, I sympathize deeply with all of those feelings and share in many of them. Throughout this process, I want to personally assure you that I have expressed your concerns to the school, and Student Government is working closely with University administration to get through this difficult time as quickly as possible to provide you with the safe, normal semester that we all want. As this situation continues to evolve, as conversations are had and decisions continue to be made, I will do everything I possibly can to advocate on your behalf and keep you updated with how the process evolves.  As always, thank you for the continued privilege to serve you as your Student Body President.\",\n",

       " \"How to find cheaper textbooks Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my process for finding textbooks as cheap as possible. Some of you may already know this stuff, but posting extra info can never hurt.\\n\\nFirst thing's first, if you have a textbook that's required and only available custom from UNCC, you usually just have to get it straight from them. You rarely may be able to find it in some other places, but I normally just get them from the school. \\n\\nIf it's not one only written by the school, the first thing I do is check out the book titles using a custom-written Google search engine. You can just put in the name of the textbook, and it'll try to find matching PDF files for those books. With some things, it might be better to have a physical book, but for smaller classes where you don't care too much to use a physical book, a PDF can be found pretty easily through this search engine as long as it exists. I've gotten a few books for less important classes like LBSTs through here.\\n\\n[Custom Google search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=011394183039475424659:5bfyqg89ers)\\n\\nMy next step is using [isbnsearch.org](https://isbnsearch.org/) which is quite honestly the only other website you need. It brings up a lot of current stores selling or renting the book by ISBN and I save hundreds of dollars each semester going through here, usually renting whatever is cheapest unless a purchasable book is even cheaper. A $175 book was about $10 rented, which was the greatest change I saw. \\n\\nIf you want to possibly find even cheaper versions, searching to see if that book has a comparable international version can be helpful too. I got one of my engineering textbooks in the international form, and after double-checking that the book pages and content were the same, it saved me about 70 bucks over the US version.\\n\\nI've just heard from some people that they don't know where else to go besides something like Chegg or UNCC's store (which is almost always the worst) so I figured I'd share the stuff I've found from my research.\\n\\nLast semester I would have burned about $300 going through UNCC's store, and doing this I only spent about $120. This semester would have been $372, and I only paid $197. \\n\\nEnjoy saving money on overpriced textbooks, and good luck next semester :)\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nUse this [custom google search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=011394183039475424659:5bfyqg89ers) to see if PDFs of the books exist\\n\\nIf not, use [isbnsearch.org](https://isbnsearch.org/) to compare prices of many places listing the books\\n\\nCheck for international versions that could save you some money for the same book\",\n",

I got so frustrated I gave up during spring 2021 after the withdraw period and just let my classes go(I think I passed one of them but that's it) I was notified that if I wanted to continue to to receive financial aid I needed to fill out a SAP(Satisfactory Academic Progress) form which I did, and it stated that I needed to achieve a 2.5 GPA or better and make a passing or better grade in 75% of the courses I enrolled in, and that I had 3 semesters to do it(the max number of SAP appeals one can apply for is 3 so I figured 3 semesters), so I was led to believe that  I had 3 semesters to get my act together. Fall 21 semester I was still struggling with untreated ADHD until October 8th at which point I finally got medication that helped, but by that point of my 3 classes, calc 1 was in the low 40% range and my other 2 classes were low 70s. I spent the last 2 months of the semester fighting to get my calc 1 grade back to an acceptable level(I finished in the low 70% range!) and my other two classes finished with a D and a C. those grades aren't great I know, but they met the requirements of the SAP appeal so I thought I was good to go for next semester which was when I was going to improve my GPA.  \\n\\n\\nNow I'm being told I'm outright suspended from the university and have to appeal that suspension. According to my advisor I was expected to raise my GPA to a 2.3(from a 1.68) last semester and if I don't get that appeal I'm barred from attending the university for 2 years, I cant afford to be out of college that long. I guess my question is, why wasn't I told about this before the fall semester even began? or when I spoke with my advisor in November? why is this being dropped on me with zero fucking warning? Why does the SAP appeal imply I have 3 semesters to raise my GPA but apparently I don't?\",\n",

I don’t care for math that much but I do enjoy it when I understand it and I find it kinda fun doing multi step problems. However, the big down part of engineering is that I don’t know if I’ll enjoy physics and all the math. I didn’t take physics in high school. I thought about the PA route because I love biology and want to learn more about the human body. However, I don’t know if I would like dealing with patients.

I just need some help and answers!)\\n\\nI am an only child with a family who is not close to my mom, dad and I. When the holidays come around, no one comes over to our house. They never have. So growing up, I never liked having people over, and didn’t know what is was like to always have family around you, and there to rely on all of the time. Over the pandemic, I had only one friend who’s now my best friend. But her family always gets in the way of things. Every time I want to hang out with her, she can’t because she’s either taking care of her newborn nephew, or is always with her grandma or is with her cousin, or sister, or because they’re having a party at her house with her family, or just because her family is coming over in general. Like seriously?! I even told her I was jealous of her cousin because I wish I was her because she gives her all of her attention! I’m always at home, alone and bored at times waiting for some attention because all of the friends I had have stopped talking to me since the beginning of the pandemic separated us. The worst part is that she lives in the neighborhood directly across from mine!! And the things I want to do with her doesn’t take all day. I just want to spend maybe an hour or two with her. But she can’t give me the light of day to hang out with her ONCE. I now have a job, and I only have so many days I can hang out with her. I even made sure to let her know IN A WEEK’S ADVANCE that we need to do something together, but she IS ALWAYS BUSY THE DAYS I PICK!! For Christmas, we both bought roller skates to hang out in when together, but even the day AFTER Christmas, she’s not available to roller skate with me because she’s having a Christmas party with her family. Um, ALL DAY?! I told her that I was working every day after the day after Christmas, but she didn’t TRY to budge. I’m trying to stay friends with her the best I can because we have so much in common and there’s no drama going on in our friendship. But as an only child who’s been basically neglected by people/family her entire life, I believe I deserve more! I feel all of these feelings, and I always regret feeling this way, but I can’t help it. Should I even regret it at all? Am I in the wrong? Am I too clingy at times? \\n\\nMost importantly, do I need to find a new friend?',\n",

I am a Senator who is the Chair of the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y’all on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.\\n\\n**Campus Lighting-** I had a meeting this week with John Bogdan, Associate Vice Chancellor for Safety and Security at Charlotte (AVC), to discuss concerns I have heard regarding lighting around campus. Before the meeting, I went out at night to gain my own perspective of where I believe the most lighting issues are present. The conclusion I came to was the same as the concerns I had been hearing: campus lighting is overall great, but there are a few lights that do not work, and lighting around Greek Village and the Greenway are not great. When meeting with AVC Bogdan, he informed me that he had been looking into solutions for the Greenway lighting for multiple years, but it is a difficult task considering the Greenway is owned by the City of Charlotte and it would be very expensive to complete. That does not mean the task is impossible though and AVC Bogdan is still looking into increasing the lighting in that area. Greek Village, on the other hand, is owned by the University and would not be quite as costly. AVC Bogdan noted that he had not been in that area in quite some time, but now that he is aware of the issue, he will head over there and determine where new lights need to be placed to increase lighting.\\n\\n**Car Break Ins-** During my meeting with John Bogdan, I discussed the University’s plan for combating these recent car break ins. If you didn’t know- earlier this week 24 cars were broken into around campus. A total of three items were reported missing, so most of the damage came from broken windows, slashed tires, and other car damages. AVC Bogdan informed me that increasing security to prevent these types of situations has been an ongoing investigation for the past couple of months. Thankfully, the University was just approved by the North Carolina Board of Governors for around one and a half million dollars to increase the number of cameras and security present around campus and specifically in parking lots/decks. While this increased security is being put into place, AVC Bogdan let me know that there is an increased police and direct patrol presence to reduce the possibility of another situation like the one that happened earlier this week. Though security has been and is being improved, it is always a good reminder to lock your car doors and not to leave valuables in your cars.\\n\\n**COVID-19 and Next Semester-** As you might have heard by now, we had a student test positive for the [Omicron strand of COVID-19](https://emergency.charlotte.edu/communications/ninernotice/latest-ninernotices). This is certainly not expected, but Dick has connected with AVC Bogdan and they discussed how early studies show that Omicron is more transmissible but we don’t have reason to believe at this time that it is significantly more dangerous. The University is committed to monitoring ongoing changes as they have been throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and will adjust accordingly. As of right now, barring any sort of drastic shift, the University is still committed to a relatively normal spring semester. I spoke to Dick and he anticipates that we will still be in person and we will continue to wear masks indoors as we have been. Just a reminder, the best way we can ensure the preservation of a regular semester is to get the COVID-19 vaccine, any applicable booster shots, and to continue to observe the mask policy. Doing so gives us the best chance to keep Niner Nation safe.\\n\\nI hope you all had an amazing semester. As this was my first semester in SGA here at Charlotte, I wanted to thank you all again for the amazing opportunity to represent y’all. I am very excited to keep providing SGA updates for many semesters to come. Also, if you noticed in the opening paragraph, I was just recently elected to the Chair of the Publicity and Outreach Committee. I am honored to serve in this position and I will do my best to ensure all students' voices are heard and all students are aware of the work we do in SGA. I wish all of you luck on your finals, Happy Holidays, and have a great rest of your year! If you have any questions/concerns or you just want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out anytime via email at jmorr151@uncc.edu. I can also meet up in person for more prominent issues if necessary, I have a flexible schedule. Go Niners!\",\n",

There is a Pre Calc course although 1103 looks like it's more geared for stem students going into 1241. Would I be ok going Stright into 1120?

       " 'SGA Update 11/25/2021🦃 Hey everyone,\\n\\nI hope this finds you well. For those who are unfamiliar with me, I am Joe Morris. I am a Senator who is the Vice Chair or the Publicity and Outreach Committee within the Student Government Association here at Charlotte. I wanted to update y’all on what is going on around the University and throughout SGA. Before I begin, I want to explicitly state that the opinions expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect that of the University, SGA, or the Publicity and Outreach Committee.\\n\\n**HEERF III Update-** If you are unaware, HEERF III is essentially a stimulus check for Charlotte students who meet the qualifications. During the HEERF III wave earlier this year, the university decided to save some money in reserve. This was with the expectation that it would have longer lasting effects throughout the rest of the year. When the Delta variant caused a massive spike in COVID cases across the states and country, it was clear that the decision to keep funds for another wave of HEERF III was a good idea. The second wave of HEERF III is now going out to students who qualify. Many people who qualify for aid still have not received an email about their funds. We believe that the emails are sent out in waves. Dick is going to touch base with Bruce Blackmon, the Director of Financial Aid, on Monday to confirm. It is also possible that the holidays have factored into this. If you think you qualify for HEERF III and you are yet to receive an email, wait about a week to see if you are in one of the later waves of emails. If you still haven’t received an email by the end of next week and you believe you may qualify, I suggest that you reach out to the financial aid office or fill out an emergency aid application. Also, to reiterate what Dick stated last update, I am aware that the holiday season and Black Friday are approaching quickly, but I encourage anyone who receives aid and has an outstanding balance with the university to strongly consider prioritizing paying off that tab first.\\n\\n**Swipe Out Hunger-** Swipe Out Hunger is a drive by Charlotte where you can take left over meal swipes you have at the end of the semester and you can donate them to students who have financial need or food insecurity instead of the meal swipes just vanishing. Currently, students must manually go through the Niner Diners mobile app to donate their extra swipes. Many questions have arisen, and I believe rightfully so, about why the university does not automatically donate leftover meal swipes. We reached out to Leadership and Community Engagement at Charlotte to discuss this issue and they are looking into this situation. Because of Thanksgiving break it is difficult to reach out to people, but the situation is currently being looked into.\\n\\n**Increased Wages for Returning Dining Service Employees-** One of the potential causes of the staffing and hiring problems was wage issues for workers. The reason for poor hours and food quality in dining areas also can be traced back to staffing and hiring issues. SGA has been working hard since the beginning of the semester in order to increase student wages. I give props to Christian Rios, the Chair of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, who worked with the Associate Vice Chancellor for Business Services and the Interim Director of Auxiliary Services and Food Services Program Manager to discuss a potential wage increase for food service workers on campus. The university administration has formally approved a $0.50 wage increase every August for every student who returns after a year of previous work, increasing their base pay successfully every academic year they return to work for dining services. We hope this wage increase will aid the staffing and hiring issues that we currently face.\\xa0\\n\\nAs it is Thanksgiving, I would like for you to all know that I am extremely thankful I am for each of you for giving me the opportunity to serve in this position. I would also like to thank all SGA members for the work we all do to represent the student body. If you have any questions/concerns or you just want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out anytime via email at jmorr151@uncc.edu. I can also meet up in person for more prominent issues if necessary, I have a flexible schedule. I hope you all are enjoying your break and have a Happy Thanksgiving! Go Niners!',\n",

I would like to go into a master’s program after undergrad but recently, my experience with one of my chem classes had left me feeling worthless and not cut out for my field.

[Swipe out hunger email](https://i.imgur.com/lCu9j69.png)\\n\\nI got this email about donating meal swipes to other students to help them with food security, which is prefaced with:\\n\\n**\"Did you know that one in three college students experience food insecurity?\"**\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t surprise me one bit. College students are being squeezed for every last drop of their money through ever-increasing tuition and fees, including paying for meal plans. \\n\\nWhy does this need to be a thing? Why is the university we attend asking the STUDENTS who already pay so much, to give to others in need? This should be a responsibility of the UNIVERSITY.\\n\\nUNCC earned a total of 794.2 million dollars in the fiscal year of 2021 ([source from audit here](https://finance.charlotte.edu/resources/informational-documents/financial-statement-audit-reports-year-end-2017-2021)). 27% of this was student tuition and fees, which equates to about 214.4 million dollars. \\n\\nOperating costs were 644.1 million dollars, which leaves us at a profit of 150 million dollars. \\n\\nThe university is profiting over 100 million dollars a fiscal year, and can\\'t spare enough to remove the problem of food insecurity? They are instead asking the students who are desperately in need of any financial assistance possible for their already paid for swipes. In the 214.4 million dollars that specifically students paid, there isn\\'t any money able to be allocated to those who are in so much financial turmoil that they can\\'t even buy food?\\n\\nIf any of my perceptions are off here, please explain them to me, as it\\'s possible there are more complexities than I\\'ve seen. However from what I can tell, this looks like a mass deflection of issues onto the students to make them feel like it\\'s their problem, instead of the massive university who is charging $10/meal to everyone who uses their dining hall.\\n\\nAs well, I realize that the food pantry exists and that is a wonderful cause that benefits a lot of students, however even that is bittersweet to think about. Many students wouldn\\'t need that food pantry if they could actually afford the meal swipes with a financial aid discount or some other program enabled by any of this massive profit.\\n\\nI\\'m just so tired of being overcharged in every aspect of going to university, and seeing this email saddened me knowing all of the help the university can provide with such a small portion of their profits, yet instead they have to preserve every penny to the point they\\'re willing to starve those one in three students unless other paying students will fork over their swipes.',\n",
